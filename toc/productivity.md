# Productivity

> Anyone can be busy. All you need to do to feel busy is to try to get two things done at onceâ€“or seek to beat a deadline that is stressing you out.
>
> Productivity, on the other hand, has little to do with busy. Productivity requires bringing real, soft skills to the table in service of the work you seek to do. **Productivity is a learned skill.**
