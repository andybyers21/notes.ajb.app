# About These Notes
{: .fs-9 }

These are my live evergreen notes and here is some information about them. Note: Some rare notes may have dead links. Where a link is prepended by "TK" this is a work in progerss and link back to my ideation area which will become live in due time.

*Something about create speculative outlines as you write*

*I will put some links to note examples in wikilink format here.*

*Why is my table of contents in a different order to my menu bar??* *Both should have no `nav_order`*

I've deliberately not used a table of contents in order to facilitate serindipidous connections.

Only breaking up notes into topics,however there is cross references in many notes taking you into the tunnels of other topics.

See the note that has the but about tunnels and curves for more on about these notes.
