## Are You Busy or Productive? When You Get Clear on What Matters, You Weed out What Doesn’t
{: .fs-5}
Multitasking is an apparent human ability to perform more than one task or activity at the same time. Such as texting while driving. If you follow any productivity blogs for any length of time, you’ll soon realise that multitasking really means “doing several things badly at once.” The brain needs time to adjust when navigating different tasks and switching back and forth makes you tired and unproductive, not the tasks themselves. So how can a modern-day knowledge worker combat this friction?

The answer isn’t another new product or task manager. The answer is a new strategy. It’s easy to get sucked into an endless cycle of emails, obligations and fire fighting. To avoid this trap, try to design your perfect week. When you understand the themes of your biggest priorities you can assign them to your days of the week to be sure you're always working on the right thing. Themes create a template for your week so you can quickly and easily generate your most important tasks for the day. Instead of working on whatever is at the top of your ever-growing to-do list, you have a roadmap of what needs your attention most. And you have the confidence to let go of the rest because you know it will get done on the designated day.

The basic process goes like this:
1. Establish your office hours. It’s no use assigning your biggest priorities when you know you're going to be out of the office.
2. Write out the tasks carry out regularly and uncover the themes within them. For example, admin, content creation, marketing, networking etc. and split them out into four-five key areas (assuming that you have a 5 day work week. Adjust accordingly otherwise).
3. Assign each theme to a day of the week that suits you best.
4. Follow your themes (with wiggle room).

Now it’s as simple as putting your themes into practice during the week. By theming your days, you will no longer wake up asking yourself, “What should I work on today?” If you batch similar tasks that call for a similar mindset you can efficiently work on multiple tasks without losing your flow and reduce decision fatigue. In other words, your brain is focused on one type of task at a time.

## Heres How I Currently Plan My Week:

### Mondays Are for Business Admin
{: .no_toc}
Mondays are for taking care of business, My goal at the end of the week is to have my desk clear and a plan in place so I can start the week with a clear head to tackle problem-solving and strategy.

Monday is also the time I usually take care of the boring stuff like business admin and finances.

### Tuesdays Are for Marketing, Biz-Dev and Networking
{: .no_toc}
Tuesdays are all about collaboration, with stakeholders and teams, client meetings and new business development. Initially, I'll work on work on our marketing efforts and SEO with the remainder of the day focused on collaborative work.

- Mondays and Tuesdays are where the majority of meetings fall and the rest of the week is more focused towards deeper work.

### Wednesdays, Product and Website Development
{: .no_toc}
The first task on Wednesday is usually to review the product roadmap and examine the progress we’re making. Then the rest of the day is dedicated to product and website development. This varies based on where we are on marketing and the go-to-market roadmap.

Wednesday is also the time to review all of our user feedback and to put it into action.

### Thursdays Are Dedicated to Content Creation
{: .no_toc}
On Thursdays, I'll work typically work on content creation for [the newsletter](/newsletter) or a [longform essay](/essays). Alternatively, I might have to work on business plans, procedures, processes or copy-write for product offerings. Either way, you'll find me in front of a keyboard for the bulk of the day. I usually have several drafts on the go with collected snippets of information and ideas and today I will put that into context and finalise my work.

### Friday Are Wobbly
{: .no_toc}
On Fridays, I'll handle anything that didn’t get done earlier in the week. I'll often need to finalise yesterdays content creation. Sometimes I'll need to finalise some dev work or catch up on the small tasks that have accumulated during the week. e-mails, planning, bills, looking up information, arranging meetings, filling out forms, etc. (All of these administrative tasks should be time blocked and grouped in an effective manner to make maximum progress without shifting focus.) Therefore, Fridays are always the most flexible day of the week.

By the end of the day, I'll aim to carry out my weekly review. Purge emails to make sure everything is closed out and review our long term goals to make sure we're on track. I'll reflect on the week and prepare for what’s to come in the week ahead.

Here's an example of how I plan my week in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I try to keep it as simple as possible. Working with high-level tasks keeps enough flexibility while keeping on top of my to-do and I can link back to my daily notes for more details. N.b. I find using plain text keeps me on track without worrying too much how my notes program functions and spending half a day playing with settings.

As you can see, it's pretty simple and there's room to manoeuvre. This is deliberate, no two weeks will ever be the same. There are always going to be fires to put out along the way but organising your week this way gives you a framework to work within and it will be clear to you when you go off track. Depending on your workload you might oversee different areas of responsibility so you could split your days if you know one task won't take up the full day.

I'll set up my system to take into account what my quarterly and yearly goals are, this way I can see that I’m making an impact over the long term. I also make sure I have enough time to achieve everything my team and I planned to do day-to-day. I'll set a calendar reminder quarterly to review my priorities and, if required, shift my daily focus in some areas. I'll also do this when I notice a shift in workloads. When you get clear on what matters, you weed out what doesn’t.
