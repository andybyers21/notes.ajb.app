Knowledge is power, and you’re going to need a lot of it if you’re going to be able to steer your business to success. **DON’T “JUST READ”— READ TO LEAD**

Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur or an entrepreneur who is striving to make your business successful, learning from successful entrepreneurs’ experiences can help you grow faster. You won’t find a how-to here. These books go deeper than that. Giving us frameworks we can work from to inspire you to develop your own.

A lot of books we could have put on this list are front-loaded in the value department. The author lays the premise at the start, and the rest is mostly repetition and anecdotes. But these are foundational works straight from the mouths of those who’ve done it right. It’ll take multiple rereads to keep getting new and insightful ideas.

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 the tech company was on the brink of failure. During the final quarter of 1996, Apple’s sales plummeted by 30 percent. Microsoft was the dominant computer company in the market. Walter Isaacson’s bestseller details how Steve took the brand from here to the most valuable company of the 21st century and paints a revealing picture of one of our generations most successful brand builders.

By the time he died, in October 2011 Jobs’ had laid the groundwork for Apple’s continued innovation by developing Apple’s distinct voice - simple, declarative, clean - an integrated approach. Steve’s creative business design celebrated not what computers could do, specs, performance and whatnot, but to celebrate what creative people could do with computers.

Jobs and Apple took end-to-end responsibility for the user experience, something too few companies do, taking responsibility for the entire product experience. Fine details such as packaging design are critical to apple when you consider that the ritual of unpacking a new product is a special occasion for your consumers.

![Principles by Ray Dalio](/assets/images/principles ray dalio.jpg){: style="float: left"}

Ray Dalio, one of the world’s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he’s developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business. Principles which any person or organisation can adopt to help achieve their goals. The book is divided first into an autobiography, then life principles to apply to individual success and finally work principles that guide group success. Dalio shares the decision making systems and idea meritocracy that has led his company, Bridgewater Associates, and over 1500 employees, to managing over $150 Billion in managed assets.

He has created an operating system for living based on radical honesty and radical transparency thriving within an idea meritocracy. A system that brings together smart, independent thinkers and has them productively disagree to come up with the best possible collective thinking. Determining an idea’s legitimacy based on track record and the ability of the idea’s originator to clearly explain their concept. Dalio believes an idea meritocracy is the best decision-making system because it requires honesty and leads to continual improvement. His goal is to inspire people to discover and write their principles and to refine them through experience and reflection. Dalio believes good, experience-tested principles can lead people to better decisions, more mutual understanding, and superior outcomes.

## Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action
### by Simon Sinek
{: .no_toc}
[Start With Why](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/0241958229/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HZCYMI1IW3DB&dchild=1&keywords=start+with+why&qid=1589205936&sprefix=start+with+%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-1) on Amazon

![Start With Why by Simon Sinek](/assets/images/start with why.jpg){: style="float: left"}

In 2009 Simon Sinek gave a TED called “[How great leaders inspire action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4) .” This 18 and a half minute TED talk has garnered over twelve million views and counting. Sinek starts with some fundamental questions: Why are some people and organisations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?

Sinek provides a simple but powerful model for how leaders inspire action. In the beginning, ideas are fuelled by passion. But for passion to thrive and survive, it also needs structures and “Hows.” Most companies fail because both “Hows” and “Whys” need each other. Starting with a golden circle and the question “Why?” “Why” isn’t just a word, it’s a powerful concept. In this telling book, Sinek demonstrates why organisations guided by this concept will succeed more often than those which don’t. Examples include Apple, Martin Luther King, and the Wright brothers

We must take initiative in our lives to become great leaders. Without having a “Why” we will struggle becoming great leaders.

## Measure What Matters: OKRs, The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth
### by John Doerr
{: .no_toc}
[Measure What Matters](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Measure-What-Matters-Simple-Drives/dp/024134848X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2SRJFZDMK5EEX&dchild=1&keywords=measure+what+matters&qid=1589208029&sprefix=measure+%2Caps%2C153&sr=8-1) on Amazon

![Measure What Matters by John Doerr](/assets/images/measure what matters.jpg){: style="float: left"}

> ”If we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing.”  

In 1999 venture capitalist John Doerr got his VC firm Kleiner Perkins to invest $11.8 million for 12% of the start-up Google Corp.  In this book, he describes the goal-setting system of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) that has helped  Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt achieve explosive growth—and how it can help any organisation with ambitious goals thrive. Goals can measure anything and everything, OKR’s focus on measuring what matters.

Doerr learned about the objective and key results goal-setting framework while interning at Intel in the ‘70s. Since then, he has been the biggest evangelist for this simple, yet powerful tool. OKRs provide focus, alignment, commitment, and the tracking and stretching of goals. By definition, start-ups wrestle with ambiguity… You’re not going to get the system just right the first time around. It’s not going to be perfect the second or third time, either. But don’t get discouraged. Persevere. You need to adapt it and make it your own.”

Why is this book worth our time?
1. We spend too much time “at work’ not doing the “important work.” This book will help us discover what is important, and help us focus on it.
2. We spend too much time wondering if we are making progress. This book will make it possible to chart progress.
3. This book basically tells us how to work in the modern era.

## Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.
### by Ron Chernow
{: .no_toc}
[Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Vintage/dp/1400077303/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=titan&qid=1589212658&sr=8-4) on Amazon

![Titan by Ron Chernow](/assets/images/titan.jpg){: style="float: left"}

What can the richest man of the modern world teach us about modern strategy? John D. Rockefeller, the worlds first billionaire and the patriarch of America’s most famous dynasty, is probably not a name that you associate with startups or small businesses. But there are many lessons that we can take from his success.

Critics charged that his empire was built on unscrupulous tactics. Grand-scale collusion, predatory pricing, industrial espionage, and wholesale bribery. While providing abundant new evidence of Rockefeller’s misdeeds, Chernow discards the stereotype of a cold-blooded monster to sketch an unforgettably human portrait of a quirky, eccentric original. A devout Baptist and temperance advocate, Rockefeller gave money more generously than anyone before him.

By the age of 20, John D. Rockefeller had established the foundations of his personal and professional life. From that point forward he had a single-minded objective that would make him both the wonder and terror of American business. Most of all, Rockefeller was an extremely sophisticated businessman laser-focused on his numbers as a being a fierce competitor. He strove for efficiency, stability and profitability in every aspect of his business. During his career, Rockefeller cut the unit costs of refined oil almost in half, and he never deviated from this gospel of industrial efficiency.”

However, what most people don’t remember about Rockefeller was one of his greatest talents. Managing and motivating his diverse associates. As he said;
> “It is chiefly to my confidence in men and my ability to inspire their confidence in me that I owe my success in life.”   
Free of an autocratic temperament, Rockefeller was quick to delegate authority and presided lightly, genially, over his empire, exerting his will in unseen ways.

As the architect of the first great industrial trust, he proved the ultimately fragile nature of free markets, forcing the government to specify the rules that would ensure competition and fair play in the future. The fiercest robber baron had turned out to be the foremost philanthropist. Rockefeller accelerated the shift from the personal, ad hoc charity that had traditionally been the province of the rich to something both more powerful and more impersonal.”

Author Ron Chernow does an amazing job with this book. Especially for entrepreneurs. Read closely and follow the blueprints on how to dominate an industry!

## Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder
### by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
{: .no_toc}
[Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Antifragile-Things-that-Gain-Disorder/dp/0141038225/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=antifragile&qid=1589213793&sr=8-1) on Amazon

![Antifragile Taleb](/assets/images/antifragile.jpg){: style="float: left"}

> “Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.”  

Antifragility is a property of systems that increase in capability to thrive as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. Especially timely in today’s uncertain world.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb divides the world and all that’s in it (people, things, institutions, ways of life) into three categories: the fragile, the robust and the antifragile. You are fragile if you avoid disorder and disruption for fear of the mess they might make of your life: you think you are keeping safe, but really you are making yourself vulnerable to the shock that will tear everything apart. You are robust if you can stand up to shocks without flinching and without changing who you are. But you are antifragile if shocks and disruptions make you stronger and more creative, better able to adapt to each new challenge you face. Taleb thinks we should all try to be antifragile.

When you’re antifragile you become stronger when attacked. Take upside risks while protecting your downsides. The ideas presented are nice and neat, however, the book that houses it is just the opposite. It is a big, baggy, sprawling mess. - But if you can stomach it and drill down into the core ideas it will set you up with a framework to become antifragile in business and in life. When we can build antifragile systems, they will thrive in our uncertain and inherently risky world.

## Outliers: The Story of Success
### by Malcolm Gladwell
{: .no_toc}
[Outliers: The Story of Success](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0141036257/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=outliers&qid=1589292540&sr=8-1) on Amazon



#### *Outlier:*
{: .no_toc}
1. Something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body.
2. A statistical observation that is markedly different in value from the others of the sample.

![Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell](/assets/images/outliers.jpg){: style="float: left"} Outliers explains why “the self-made man” is a myth and what truly lies behind the success of the best people in their field. Gladwell’s purpose was to inform reader’s on how successful people achieve success through the help of others, practice, and opportunity. He also wanted to get rid of our society’s crude perspective on how outliers become successful. A crude perspective might be, “Bill Gates is successful because he’s really smart”, but Gladwell wanted to go further than that generalisation. He wanted to know how Bill Gates became successful, not just assume. “He didn’t start out an outlier, he started out just a little bit better,” says Gladwell.

Throughout the book, Gladwell proves this theory for all of the outliers, stating that they had something, whether it was accidental or on purpose that pushed them towards success. Often a series of lucky events, rare opportunities and other external factors, which are out of our control. Often a series of calculated decisions that you or I could make to steer the course.  Outliers is a systematic debunking of the myth that success is mostly determined by talent and hard work alone.

## The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon
### by Brad Stone

[The Everything Store](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon/dp/0552167835/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+everything+store&qid=1589294880&sr=8-1) on Amazon

![The Everything Store](/assets/images/the everything store.jpg){: style="float: left"}

Amazon is a modern Standard Oil being built today and Jeff Bezos is the Titan behind it. A strategic genius and icon of cost leadership and diversification. In The Everything Store, Brad Stone gives us the closest biographical documentation of the unprecedented rise of Amazon. Based on over 300 interviews with current and former Amazon employees and executives, family members of the founder and the hard facts available to the public.

You will learn why Bezos chose to start small, with books and has continually expanded into the behemoth that is Amazon today and how he continually disrupts his own markets with products like the kindle. The book covers Amazon’s expansions and growing pains, the hiring and departure of numerous executives.

Amazon is so many things at once—a rapidly expanding global mega-retailer operating in more than a dozen countries, a Web services provider, a publisher with eleven imprints, a hardware manufacturer, a video-streaming service, a constant e-commerce innovator, and much more. The book can’t cover each of amazons products in detail but what it does do is give us a breakdown of the thought processes behind them leaving us with a framework for making our own interpretations.

The book covers Amazon’s expansions and growing pains, the hiring and departure of numerous executives. If you have your own vision that seems to be bigger than the world itself, you can learn a couple lessons from the meteoric rise of this $100+ billion per year company and the philosophy of its founder.
