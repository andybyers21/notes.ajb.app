# notes.ajb.app

This page is my personal research environment and an experiment in learning in public.

I built this site as a vault for my ongoing note taking. The topics are broad and cover things like self-education, computer science & web concepts, personal knowledge management (PKM), productivity, entrepreneurship, strategy, marketing, wealth creation, note taking and whatever other rabbit holes I find myself in.

I’ve committed to sharing my findings with the world. If you’re willing to let people access your life, they’ll find what they need to help you succeed.
