# notes.ajb.app

This is the data for my Evergreen notes vault hosted at [notes.ajb.app](https://notes.ajb.app/). It is automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub and hosted by [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/43f05955-0f84-4186-bbd5-14175f0919fa/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/affectionate-goldstine-d6699d/deploys)

It's built on the excellent [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) framework by [
Patrick Marsceill](https://github.com/pmarsceill).

Notes are written in markdown format and I can easily create links to related thoughts using **[[Wikilinks]]**.
