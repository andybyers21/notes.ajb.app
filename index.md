# Hi, I'm Andy Byers

I'm a software developer from the UK with goals in building knowledge management for the web.

## About These Notes

I built this site as a vault for my ongoing note taking. The topics are broad and cover things like self-education, personal knowledge management (PKM), productivity, software development, entrepreneurship, strategy, marketing, finance, and whatever other rabbit holes I find myself in. I’ve committed to sharing my findings with the world. *If you’re willing to let people access your life, they’ll find what they need to help you succeed.*

This page is my personal research environment and an experiment in learning in public. We need good tools for thinking, which means we need good tools for capturing, storing and most importantly connecting our ideas and making our knowlege accessible. There’s no good reason to silo different kinds of data anymore. My aim is to distill credible information into manageable chunks and distribute at scale. 

Note catagorisation is loosely based on the zettelkasten system. Whenever you add a new note, the zettelkasten method forces you to look for already existing notes you can link to. That broadens your thinking by forcing you to consider how new ideas relate to others you’ve encountered before. Notes are sorted by category in the main menu however I recommend diving in at whichever branch interests you and allow knowledge to flow in its own direction by following links and making serendipitous connections, building on a core concept in order to think more effectively. 

If you start with an initial idea you cannot help but filter everything you encounter. However, the Zettelklasten system has no preconceptions of what it is fed over the long term, it builds on your thoughts over a period of time that could possibly span years. New ideas and insights will form just by comparing notes side by side. In turn, questions will emerge from the work, rather than being imposed on it.

One important notion, there will be very few straight lines within this platform. It should be dominated by curves and offshoots. 

If you want to view the code you can do so [here.](https://github.com/andybyers21/notes.ajb.app) You can see my TO-DO list for the site [here](./notes/site-info/site-todos).

*P.S. If you happen to stumble across my notes on learning to code please be aware that they are written on an Apple developer environment.*
