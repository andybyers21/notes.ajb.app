# Hi, I'm Andy Byers
{: .fs-9 }

![Andy Byers](assets/images/AndyByers1.png){: style="float: right"}

I’m the founder of [Maykind](https://maykind.com). A personal growth engine disguised as a business consultancy where I work with small businesses, helping them achieve results in areas such as strategy, growth, organisational design and productivity. I also work with retail in the non-profit sector for [Stellas Voice](https://stellasvoice.org.uk).

In the past I’ve worked in the energy sector, retail & leisure sectors and non-profit sector in both multi-national organisations as well as grass-roots family businesses.

***wikilinks only work on `layout: note` YAML tagged pages.***

I use this page to expand on my thoughts on self-education, personal knowledge management (PKM), productivity, entrepreneurship, strategy, marketing, finance, and whichever rabbit holes I find myself in this week. In an effort to connect with curious, creative, and ambitious minds I’ve committed to sharing my findings with the world. *There should be a link to [my notes](/notes) in this text here and a small description to be expanded upon in the [about these notes](/notes) page. Also should be some gibberish about my [longform writing](/essays)* If you’re willing to let people access your life, they’ll find what they need to help you succeed.

I update the site on a regular basis so you can see the updates [here](/updates)

I try to learn from everything and everyone. It’s what keeps this page, and my businesses alive.

I write a [weekly newsletter](/andybnet/newsletter) called the heads-up where I share packets of knowledge. Book notes, what I’m working on, what I’ve learned this week, new skills and ideas. No sales, no gimmicks, no bonuses, Just one e-mail a week.
