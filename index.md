# Hi, I'm Andy Byers

I'm a software developer from the UK with goals in building knowledge management for the web.

I built this site as a vault for my ongoing notes. The topics are broad and cover things like self-education, personal knowledge management (PKM), productivity, software development, entrepreneurship, strategy, marketing, finance, and whatever other rabbit holes I find myself in. I’ve committed to sharing my findings with the world. *If you’re willing to let people access your life, they’ll find what they need to help you succeed.*

## About These Notes

This page is my personal research environment and an experiment in learning in public. If you want to view the code you can do so [here.](https://github.com/andybyers21/notes.ajb.app) You can see my TO-DO list for the site [here](./notes/site-info/site-todos). Note catagorisation is loosely based on the zettelkasten principal. Notes are sorted by category in the main menu however I recommend diving in at whichever branch interests you and allow knowledge to flow in its own direction by following the wikilinks and making serendipitous connections.

One important notion, there will be very few straight lines within this platform. It should be dominated by curves and offshoots. 

If you want to get in touch with me or have any comments, you can do so by emailing me at <a href="mailto:a@ajb.app">a@ajb.app</a>

*P.S. If you happen to stumble across my notes on learning to code please be aware that they are written on an Apple developer environment.*
