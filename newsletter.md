# Newsletter
{: .fs-9 }

I constantly save packets of knowledge in a format that my future self can easily understand and I’m following a “pay it forward” strategy by sharing it with you on a weekly basis.

You won’t receive a link dump. The weekly heads-up consists of carefully curated research, articles, and discussions distributed every Sunday so you can start the week with fresh ideas.

You’ll get:

- **Update this bit fo' sure**
- The articles and links that inspired the latest post on the website.
- An insight into what I’m working on this week.
- The rabbit holes I’ve been down this week.
- Short thoughts from my Second Brain.
- Book Notes from what I’ve been reading this week spanning as broad a range of topics as the rest of the site.


Replys are open. I respond to each and every email reply from you and your fellow readers. I love getting to know new people around the world and hopefully we can make meaningful connections.

No spam. Unsubscribe anytime you want.
