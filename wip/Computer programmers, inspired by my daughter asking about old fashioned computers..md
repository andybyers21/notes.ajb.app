# Computer programmers, inspired by my daughter asking about old fashioned computers. 
Steve Jobs and bill Gates and others (HP) building computers in their shed became computer builders. We don't have any major innovations in computer building recently. Building generation. 

See Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell for further inspiration

### A voyage of discovery
When we were kids we had to type c://load.dir/doom and it was magical. We learned about hire achy and computer type shit from being tiny. We are programming gwneration
Even a few years back stuff was on demand, on the desktop but kids could still explore (and probably break a few times) the family computer
Now kids don't have the opportunity to do that. Many homes don't even have a computer, just a ipad and a phone so even if they wanted to they couldn't explore. Stuff just arrived at their fingertips. 
There's even on demand stuff now if you want to make things. Videos, websites, basic apps. If kids don't need the backend knowledge it's not there when they need it in a developer type career. 
Will this cause a drought of competent and passionate programmers and developers.
