* In the online economy there’s two ways to buy products. Either with cash or by trading for data. 
* In conclusion, the ROI is bad. 
* With Google I sell some of my data in exchange for products I _want_ to use (gmail, calendar, drive etc.) 
* Facebook willingly takes that data in exchange for products I neither want or need. It’s only because half the planet is addicted to the fb dopamine hit or has legacy accounts (like me) that they never use any more but still use messenger and unbeknowns shares massive amounts of personal data. 
* And Facebook is bad for mental health, algorithms promote negative things. 
* Facebook = world domination in every aspect of life. social, gaming, messenger/communication. Designed to keep you connected and like crack, it’s difficult to get out. 
* It’s deliberately over complicated in an attempt to keep you tied down and has many links back to your personal page to to keep you wrapped up and eat your data up for its marketing machine. 8 still have an account for the business page I manage. Here’s all the links
* Compare that to twitter. Business email, create new account. Done. No connection to my personal or other businesses. 
* Twitter, yes but not so much. social only. 
* Twitter to engage with people. 
* email because I own it. If mail chimp goes down I’ll go to another email provider. email doesn’t change its algorithm.

> But on a smart phone, the enter key is your publish button. So your text, your Slack message, or your tweet happens as soon as you type a single sentence.    
> That’s good for platforms that want to deliver the endorphin hit of a mic drop, but not particularly helpful in sharing complex ideas. And the ideas that are worth sharing are the complex ones    
- **email, does not try to hook you in with endorphin bursts.** 


Write an article on what happens after digital minimalism and deleting social and all that type of stuff. 

Like after a while you get more notification bubbles and it no longer bothers you. You no longer feel the urge to click on them instantly.
