Transparency has the power to make us more organized. Give up privacy. "No problem that you might find embarrassing is unusual."

## The only way to learn in public is to build in public

* If you’re willing to let people access your life, they’ll find what they need to help you succeed and aid us in our [[§ Learning]]
* if you fail to share ownership, you’ll also fail to get those around you to care. This is not about money; it’s about mentality. Having only one person stay up at night thinking about how to solve a problem or capitalize on a particular opportunity is frankly not enough. You need to engage your team as owners by sharing credit, sharing responsibility, and sharing financial rewards.
* Failure to share information is an integrity violation. Public information allows the space to discuss and expand on ideas. It allows new understandings of your ideas and gives you the ability to analyse your work critically.
* “An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.”
