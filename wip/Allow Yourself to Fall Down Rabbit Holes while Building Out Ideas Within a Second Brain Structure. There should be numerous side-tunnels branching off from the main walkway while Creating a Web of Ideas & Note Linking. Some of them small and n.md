Allow Yourself to Fall Down Rabbit Holes while [[Building Out Ideas Within a Second Brain Structure]]. There should be numerous side-tunnels branching off from the main walkway while [[Creating a Web of Ideas & Note Linking]]. Some of them small and narrow. Something you could only crouch within. Some will be grand and full of valuable information and insight. The tunnels will be deep and curve away from the main structure. It doesnâ€™t matter.
* One important notion. There will be very few straight lines within the platform. It should be dominated by curves and offshoots.

Dispel the notion that everything should be based on squares and rectangles and defined structures and **allow knowledge to flow in its own direction and follow its own path**. It should be dominated by curves. **Allow information to follow its own path.** You are not the designer of this architecture. Only the keeper. It will define its own structure as it grows.
