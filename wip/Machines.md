# Machines


“Machines are efficient. That’s why we build them. A plough being dragged by a horse is more efficient than a man with a spade. A tractor is even more effective again. At each point, we simplify and Focus our design. We build machines to accomplish specific tasks. Everything has a purpose. No wasted parts.”
