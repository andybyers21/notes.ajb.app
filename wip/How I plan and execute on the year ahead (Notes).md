# plan your year ahead
Take the time to reflect at the end of the week and understand what your primary goals are. Understand your macro goals and your Big 3 for the week ahead and channel your energies into achieving them. If you don’t have a big 3 or can’t verbalise your goals, it’s time to stop what your doing. Take a step back, take a breath and focus on getting your priorities straight.

Here’s a quick exercise to plan your year ahead. Block out an hour on your calendar, close the door, put your phone into airplane mode and grab yourself a pen and paper. Once you’ve got that taken care of you a can start to map out your year. Here’s what you need to do:

### 1. Capture the Three Words that you want to embody over the year ahead
Take a sheet of paper and start brainstorming some words that will best represent where you want to be in the year ahead. Take 20 minutes to do this. Set a timer if you need to.

### 2. Capture the big projects you want to accomplish in the year ahead
Take the second sheet of paper and brainstorm all of the major projects you want to work on over the next twelve months. These projects can be personal or professional (or both). Write anything that comes to mind on that paper. Take another 20 minutes to do this.

### 3. Assign the top projects to the months of the year best suited for them
The third sheet of paper is the key. It’s going to be your initial map for the year. For the final 20 minutes write down all 12 months of the year on your sheet of paper and then assign your most compelling and fulfilling projects to them. Keep in mind that some may take more than one month to complete, some may take less.

There you have it. In one hour you’ve developed a basic map for the year that will help you realize projects that may have sat on the back burner with more focus and attention. Stick this somewhere in plain sight, refer to it often and share it with your co-workers. This will give you a framework for allocating your top three weekly tasks each and every week for the next twelve months in order to realise your goals.

I set up my work calendars to take into account what my monthly goals are for myself and my team. This way I can see that I’m making an impact over the long term. I also make sure I have enough time to achieve everything my team and I planned to do day-to-day.
