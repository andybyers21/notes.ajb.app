# 14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers

* // TODO Create a list of all technologies and tools that you would like to learn. Now label each of them with a different priority: “This Week”, “Next Month”, “Next Year”. Whenever you feel like you’re missing out on some new shiny trend, revisit this list and reorganize the priority.

* Is what I am doing aligned with the trajectory of the open web, standards, and specifications I believe will stick around over the long term?

* it’s good to find a balance in what you choose to learn to keep yourself effective. When you pick just a few, high-impact choices you set yourself up to have enough time to get more depth in your technology of choice.

* If you decide to become a great developer, it’s important to understand core concepts such as algorithms, logic, network, accessibility, security, and user experience. You don’t necessarily need them to build your first app, but knowing them will help you build the next ten complex applications you will create in the future.

* // TODO Spend some time researching what the fundamental concepts in your field are. Grab a piece of paper and divide it into two columns. On the left side, list all the knowledge that you already have. On the right side, list all the knowledge that you still need to acquire. Plan a dedicated time of your day to study those concepts.

* It all starts with ABC (Always Be Coding), as cheesy as it sounds, practice makes perfect. For that reason, when learning a new programming language, I hard commit to working on it at least 1 hour a day for about 30 days consecutive. I go on YouTube and pick tutorials to build projects but I choose authors that go more in-depth on the fundamentals. While following the tutorials, I always reference the official documentation, projects’ unit tests, and popular open source projects to help frame my foundation and habits as close as possible to those already experienced in that particular language."

* Breaking the rules. Doing whatever you want. Those concepts are all admired by us. Deep down we all want to be rebels. Discipline. Consistency. Persistency. Those concepts are not sexy at all, but they are the key to playing infinite games.

* "I think I learned a lot from people that always had a good schedule/agenda in their lives. They were always on time, starting and finishing their workday on the perfect hour every single day. All of these people showed me that I would only win if I could smartly organize my day and avoid procrastination. In general, I think most of them had a positive impact on my life, encouraging me to always try to build a simple and straightforward day-to-day work pattern. Not too much on my plate, and not so little either." Berg Brandt (Amazon, Ex-Yahoo):

* the root cause is that you’re writing code for your current self. Instead, you need to write for your future self. Your current self has all the context needed to understand that block of code, whereas your future self will be involved with other things and probably won’t even remember what that function X means.

* No code should be added without unit tests,

* For first-time development with a new language/tool compare with development using a familiar language/tool, allow for a 20% to 40% increase in effort.

* Habit 2: Focus on the Fundamentals The open source community built a roadmap of fundamentals for DevOps, Front-end, and Back-end developers. Go to 14habits.com/bonus/2 to grab it.
