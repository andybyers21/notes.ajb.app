# Formula for Momentum



## Comparing % and mass
* Seth Godin -
* Direct marketers donâ€™t care how many people they reach.
* They care what percentage take action.
* Brand marketers have trouble measuring action, so all they have to work with is reach.
* If you can measure, stop worrying about big numbers when it comes to reach. Run away from the Super Bowl or a billboard on the main highway.
* Small audiences are your friend, because small audiences are specific, and specific increases your percentage.
