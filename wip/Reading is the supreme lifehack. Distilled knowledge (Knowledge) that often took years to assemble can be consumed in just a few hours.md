**Reading is the supreme lifehack.** Distilled knowledge ([[Knowledge]]) that often took years to assemble can be consumed in just a few hours

Dedicate yourself to new learning every day. Put at least fifteen minutes a day into learning a new skill of world view. **Einstein said that if someone spent fifteen minutes a day learning something new, in a year he would be an expert.**

Books can be read in two distinct ways
1. For mechanical things, how-to’s etc, I'll follow the step by step described to achieve the desired goal.
2. For creative and entrapunerial discussions (which are essentially one and the same) how-to’s only serve as inspiration. I use these as a catalyst for ideas and further discussion on a given topic.

[[Allow Yourself to Fall Down Rabbit Holes]] and be copious in [[§ Note Taking]] - Use your own words, copied quotes are worthless.

Do not believe the first thought you have on a topic. Since your mind takes what it sees and makes it happen, it is critical to visualize what you want from your learning and then match your behavior over time to get it.
