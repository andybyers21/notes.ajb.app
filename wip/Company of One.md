* There’s no such thing as perpetual growth. Yet that’s what traditional business people crave. But what is growth meant to achieve? If Oxford University is so successful, then why isn’t there a branch in Washington, D.C.? If a symphony is successful with 120 musicians, why not even more so with 600? “To grow bigger” is not much of an effective business strategy at all.  —RICARDO SEMLER, CEO OF SEMCO PARTNERS
* building a business full of resilience, driven by a desire for autonomy
* His Focus in his business was being better, not growing bigger.
* I knew what I needed to make to cover my business and my life, so I could decide to slow down when I reached “enough” as well.
* blind growth is the main cause of business problems.
* No one else cares about you keeping your job as much as you do. It’s your responsibility to define and achieve your own success,
* Companies of one within organisations don’t need to be managers or create products—they simply need to find suitable ways to become better and more productive, without more resources or team members
* If you’re a company of one, your mind-set is to build your business around your life, not the other way around.
* I just Focus on maximizing work in a way that works for me, which can sometimes mean doing less. Work can be done at a pace that suits my sanity rather than one that supports costly overhead, expenses, or salaries. As much as I enjoy growing my wealth, I also realize that there’s a point of diminishing returns if I don’t also take care of myself and my well-being.
* The first trait that resilient people have is an acceptance of reality. They don’t need for things to be a certain way and don’t engage in wishful thinking.
* As a society, we’re gradually starting to view “work” not as a single place of employment, but as a series of engagements or projects.
* When Mike Zafirovski became the CEO of Nortel, he implemented an unambiguous theme of “business made simple” across the entire company. From reducing costs to speeding up product development, to making it easier for customers to get the latest technology, he wove the idea of “simple” into every aspect of their large company.
* Sean D’Souza doesn’t want to grow his company. He decided that $500,000 a year of profit was all he wanted to earn and that his business shouldn’t exceed it.
* He believes that companies need to Focus on becoming better instead of simply growing bigger.
* VCs don’t invest millions in companies because that’s what those companies might need; rather, they invest the amount that their own VC business requires to see growth in their own portfolios, coming from the few companies that actually give them a positive return.
* Startups, as serial entrepreneur Salim Ismail states, are extremely fragile by nature. They’re designed to be temporary organisations that may grow into large companies, under conditions of extreme uncertainty.
* For companies of one, the question is always what can I do to make my business better?, instead of what can I do to grow my business larger?
* stuck to the monitor was a Post-it that read “OVERHEAD = DEATH,”
* Since the company was just him, he was also able to pivot several times when shifts in the market and specific types of work he enjoyed doing led him to niches to Focus on.
* In an ancient language from India called Pali, there’s a term, “mudita,” which seems like the opposite of envy, because it means “to delight in the good fortunes or the accomplishments of others.” (Interestingly, it has no counterpart in English.
* Where the upper bound to that scale might be, the place where profit and enjoyment have diminishing returns
* Another quality that helps is setting extremely high goals—for yourself and for others.
* Because Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, is a classic introverted leader, he enlists the help of COO Sheryl Sandberg, who offers him social and political guidance. Mark leans on smaller, genuine, collaborative connections rather than attempting to keep a large number of employees or subordinates under his rule. He’s also been very competent at persuading other startups and their founders (typically very entrepreneurial in spirit) to join Facebook, by spending a lot of time with them and listening keenly.
* Regent University found that a desire to be of service to others and to empower them to grow is a key factor in becoming a leader and retaining leadership.
* servant leadership, dating back to ancient philosophy and the Tao Te Ching, adheres to the belief that a company’s goals are best achieved by helping workers or customers achieve their goals
* Such leaders do not seek attention but rather want to shine a light on others’ wins and achievements.
* Servant leadership requires humility, but that humility ultimately pays off. Companies of one recognize that elevating others elevates the entire team or business.
* I only work with freelancers and contractors who don’t require management of any kind. They’re A-players who know exactly how to get their work done. I simply need to provide them with the parameters and let them do their work.
* I let my perceived shortcomings, like being awkward or bad at managing others, work for my business, not against it.
* My leadership style may require that I spend more when I hire (A-players come at a premium), but their work is always worth it and nets a positive return for my business.
* A leader of a company of one has the role of enabling autonomy while providing alignment-setting processes and making sure there are common goals. Achieving this delicate balance can be challenging.
* A leader’s job is to provide clear direction and then get out of the way.
* This alignment has to be carefully orchestrated, not as binary autonomous/non-autonomous decisions, but as a balance between guidance and trust. Provide too much guidance and a team will start to rely on it and leadership will become a bottleneck for decision-making. Provide too little and things devolve into anarchy. The middle ground is where high-performing teams excel, providing the most benefit to a company and delivering the most innovative and amazing results
* In school and work, we’re often taught that specialization is better and a key to success. From a young age, we’re asked to pick a track that will lead us to a specific profession. In our jobs, we often use only one specific skill set to accomplish the tasks we’re assigned. This is helpful in gaining domain expertise in a subject, but companies of one truly need to be able to know and understand a multitude of topics and skills in order to be in control of their work.
* We should never assume that having an abundance of knowledge is the same as having an abundance of wisdom.
* more isn’t better—better is better.
* Workaholism, a term coined in 1971 by psychologist Wayne Oates, is the epitome of hustling. The workaholic’s need for work becomes so excessive that it creates disturbances in their health and relationships. Interestingly, Oates found that hustlers don’t outperform nonhustlers; the only noticeable impact of their hustling is higher job stress, greater work-life conflict, and deteriorating health. His research found no relationship between workaholism and greater financial reward or self-efficacy.
* Sukhvinder Obhi, a neuroscientist at McMaster University, coined the term “power paradox” to describe what happens when we gain power through leadership: we subsequently lose some of the capabilities we needed to gain it in the first place—such as empathy, self-awareness, transparency, and gratitude. Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at Berkeley, had similar results from his twenty years of researching the behavior of leaders—the qualities that lead to the leadership roles we achieve are the exact qualities that diminish once leadership roles are attained.
* churn is what happens when existing customers decide they don’t want to be customers anymore. So the revenue they generated needs to be replaced with revenue from new customers. If your churn is higher than your user acquisition rate, then you’re in a downward spiral.
* Econsultancy/Responsys Cross-Channel Marketing Report, adding a new customer costs five times as much as keeping an existing one.
* To start a company of one, you should first figure out the smallest version of your idea and then a way to make it happen quickly. Automation can happen later. Scale, if desired, can happen later. Infrastructure and process can happen later. Focus on where you can test the waters without a massive investment of time or money, and then pay attention to what happens when casual contacts turn into customers, even if it’s only a handful at first. Why did they buy? What motivated them to do so? How can I keep them happy? And most important: How can I help them succeed?
* customers really don’t care if you’re profitable. But if what you sell them can help them become profitable, they’ll never want to leave your business.
* Customer success is the cornerstone of a profitable company of one.
* The smallest version of your business idea that you could start with now, with little to no investment
* Richard Branson summed up purpose nicely: “Success in business is no longer just about making money or moving up the corporate ladder. More and more, one of the biggest indicators of success is purpose
* While purpose is based on a core set of values held by a company or even a business owner and shared with customers, passion is simply a whim based on what we think we enjoy doing. The tired business advice that we should all “follow our passion” implies that we are entitled to getting paid to do work that is always enjoyable.
* When you Focus on solving problems or on making a difference, passion may follow, because you’re actually involved in the work you’re doing instead of just dreaming that you might be passionate about something.
* passion is the side effect of mastery.
* engaging work helps you develop passion, not the other way around.
* Engaging work comprises four key components: clearly defined assignments, tasks you excel at, performance feedback, and work autonomy.
* Passion isn’t the catalyst that creates success, but more often what develops after success is achieved.
* A Microsoft Research study found that attempting to Focus on more than one priority at a time reduces productivity by as much as 40 percent, which is the cognitive equivalent of pulling an all-nighter
* To manage yourself within a larger team, you have to become adept at articulating your workload to other people.
* Begin to Think About: The true purpose of your business and whether it shows up in your actions (not just in your marketing material)
* If you don’t think about the personality of your business, your audience will assign one to you
* The same can occur in business: since our brains are wired for relating to and remembering good stories and epic struggles, a company that isn’t telling a compelling story can devolve into boring and forgettable vanilla ice cream.
* In short, helping your customers succeed and providing amazing service are good for business.
* Being a profit-Focused company of one (fewer expenses increase revenue just as much as more profits do),
* If you serve your customers well, they in turn become brand evangelists for your company: basically an unpaid sales force that reduces your need to hire more staff.
* The problem with this kind of approach was that, however much money it saved a company, it actually created unneeded barriers between the company and customers with a problem,
* Instead of treating customer service like a cost or expense, you can view it as an investment in retention and acquisition, because you’re essentially building a customer sales force through your support staff.
* —research done by SmallBizTrends found that a staggering 83 percent of new business comes from word-of-mouth referrals
* Helping your customers as individuals requires as much empathy and care as it does to sell whatever it is you’re offering them. You have to be able to understand your customers and their needs to serve them effectively.
* But what most business owners or even team leaders often fail to consider is their customers’ success.
