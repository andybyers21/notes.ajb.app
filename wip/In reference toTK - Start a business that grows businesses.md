**In reference to:[[TK - Start a business that grows businesses]]**
* Managing growth effectively is all about making sure you have the resources to deliver. Entrepreneurs often find it hard to change their outlook to business growth. Not only lack of growth but rapid growth too. Blind growth is the main cause of business problems.
* Understanding the limit of your business capacity and how to manage it efficiently is key to sustained growth in any operation. Moving your growth journey forward in a structured way and taking the time to spot any potential problems before they bring the house down will sidestep the common traps and deliver organic revenue expansion. We understand how to recognise structural shifts in consumer preferences. For some of you the route to retaining your competitive edge will be to innovate, for others it will be to make acquisitions. For all of you, it will be to run lean and cost effective operations
* Apparent strengths and weaknesses, seen through the eyes of external consultants, can often be appropriated in ways previously not thought of.
