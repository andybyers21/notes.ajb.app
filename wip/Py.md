round(num, number_of_digits)    # Rounds off to the given number of digits and returns the floating point number, if no number of digits is provided for round off , it rounds off the number to the nearest integer.

```py
len() # NOTE: the only way you can count how many digits in a number is by turning it into a string, eg:
```

string_of_digits = str(my_num)
assert len(f”{string_of_digits}”) == 4
