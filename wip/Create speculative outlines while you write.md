## Create speculative outlines while you write
Maintain outlines as you create evergreen notes. (Prefix outlines with ยง). Create a new one if necessary and let notes from other subjects enter the outlines for new topics. Allow notes to enter as many outlines as possible.

By [[Creating a Web of Ideas & Note Linking]] **Substantially-complete writing projects will naturally emerge.**

Allowing notes to intermingle within different outlines

Normally, we start an outline when we start a writing project. This forces us to start with a blank page. By contrast, if we write new notes every day, [[TK - Take Scratch Notes]], build these out into evergreen notes by [[Building Out Ideas Within a Second Brain Structure]] and notice how they relate to each other, these can accumulate into potential writing projects. We can [[Use notes to avoid preconceived conclusions.]]

When an outline feels complete it is ready to be exported, edited and turned into a complete essay, manuscript or article without the effort of starting with a blank page

Maintaining already-written notes in an outline is comparatively easy: just look at a pair of notes and ask: which comes first? (Pirsig)

To start a writing project with a blank outline, we need to have a topic and some angle in mind. By doing the above we can just look into our evergreen notes folder and work on whichever seems most promising or interesting to us at the time.
