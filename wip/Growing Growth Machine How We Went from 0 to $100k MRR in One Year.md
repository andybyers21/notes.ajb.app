It would have been impossible to hire before I had a grasp on what our core processes were. But once those three positions were outlined, the path forward from solo operator to team operation was clear
A basic Growth Machine project has three parts:
* Content strategy
* Content production
* Content promotion
I tried a bunch of different acquisition strategies: direct outreach, incentivized referrals, guest posting, partnerships, but ultimately the same strategies that got us started kept delivering the best results. Referrals, blogging, and interviews
The absolute best way to get clients, I’ve found, is by reputation and a reasonable amount of bragging. Talking about results on this blog, in podcast interviews, and on Twitter, have led to the majority of our leads and referrals
Bill at the start of work with net 15 terms or shorter. This is almost essential for being in a good cash flow position as an agency, especially when you start hiring people.
I do free work all the time and give away freebies as a way to build good will with people who might know potential clients. I think it’s been essential for getting referrals, and it makes people feel good which is always nice
