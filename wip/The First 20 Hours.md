# The First 20 Hours

* Here’s another uncomfortable truth: many things aren’t fun until you’re good at them.

* I get up every morning determined to both change the world and have one hell of a good time. Sometimes this makes planning my day difficult. —E. B. WHITE, ESSAYIST AND AUTHOR OF CHARLOTTE’S WEB AND THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE

* Learning enhances practice, but it doesn’t replace it.

* said many wise things, but I think the following remark is among the wisest: “The best thing that can happen to a human being is to find a problem, to fall in love with that problem, and to live trying to solve that problem, unless another problem even more lovable appears.”

* The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an A, forty pounds a B, and so on. Those being graded on “quality,” however, needed to produce only one pot—albeit a perfect one—to get an A. Well, come grading time a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work and learning from their mistakes, the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

* Skill is the result of deliberate, consistent practice, and in early-stage practice, quantity and speed trump absolute quality.

* Carl Sagan, the famous physicist: “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.”
