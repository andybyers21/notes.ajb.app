# Conformation Bias
==this is from unshakable, but expand on it==

* Mistake 1: Seeking Confirmation of Your Beliefs Why the Best Investors Welcome Opinions That Contradict Their Own

* “confirmation bias,” which is the human tendency to seek out and value information that confirms our own preconceptions and beliefs. This tendency also leads us to avoid, undervalue,

* or disregard any information that conflicts with our beliefs.

* For investors, confirmation bias is a dangerous predisposition.

* Let’s say you love a particular stock or fund that’s performed exceptionally well in your portfolio over the last year. Your brain is wired to seek out and believe information that validates you owning it. After all, our minds love proof—especially proof of how smart and right we’ve been!

* Investors often visit newsletters and message boards that reinforce their beliefs about the stocks they own. Or they pump their accelerator by reading positive articles about the hot sector where they’ve been earning fabulous returns. But what if the situation changes and that high-flying stock or sector starts crashing back to earth? How well equipped are we to change our perspective and recognize that we’ve made a mistake?

* Do you have the flexibility to change your approach, or is your mind locked into its beliefs?

* another emotional bias called the “endowment effect,” in which investors place greater value on something they already own, regardless of its objective value!

* Ask Better Questions and Find Qualified People Who Disagree with You

* The best investors know they’re vulnerable to confirmation bias and, accordingly, do everything they can to counter this tendency. The key is to actively seek out qualified opinions that differ from your own. Of course, you don’t want just anyone with a different opinion, but rather someone who has the skill, track record, and intelligence to give another educated perspective. All opinions are not created equal.

* “Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.”

* You can benefit greatly as an investor by finding people you respect (ideally, this includes a financial advisor with an extraordinary long-term record) and asking them questions designed to uncover what you don’t know.

* Whenever I’m contemplating a major investment, I speak with friends who think differently,

* I explain what I believe, and then I ask: “Where could I be wrong? What am I not seeing? What’s the downside? What am I failing to anticipate? And who else should I speak with to deepen my knowledge?”

* Mistake 2: Mistaking Recent Events for Ongoing Trends Why Most Investors Buy the Wrong Thing at Exactly the Wrong Moment

* One of the most common—and dangerous—investing mistakes is the belief that the current trend will continue. And when investors’ expectations aren’t met, they often overreact, leading to a dramatic reversal of the trend that previously seemed inevitable and unstoppable.

* “Investors project out into the future what they have most recently been seeing. That is their unshakeable habit.”

* You don’t want to be that guy who, after a long, sun-drenched summer, concludes that it’ll never rain again.

* Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion.

* “The biggest mistake that the small investor makes is to buy when the market is going up on the assumption that the market will go up further—and sell when the market is going down on the assumption that it’s going to go down further.”

* today’s winners tend to be tomorrow’s losers.
