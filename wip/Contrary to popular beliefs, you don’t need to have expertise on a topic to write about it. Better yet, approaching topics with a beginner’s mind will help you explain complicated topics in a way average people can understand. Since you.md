Contrary to popular beliefs, you don‚Äôt need to have expertise on a topic to write about it. Better yet, approaching topics with a beginner‚Äôs mind will help you explain complicated topics in a way average people can understand. Since you‚Äôll remember what it felt like to be a beginner, you‚Äôll be able to write in a clear and understandable fashion.

By forcing yourself to share ideas, you can develop an immense amount of expertise on a topic in a relatively short period of time.

üèó I liked this framing of how really smart companies focus as much on [building a distribution system](http://blog.eladgil.com/2018/04/product-to-distribution.html) as they do on building their products. It applies to the TikTok discussion below, but it also applies to what we're seeing a lot of solo influencers do to build businesses around their reputation. From the article:

"1. Build a product so good that customers will use you over an incumbent. Build a large userbase on the back of this first product.

2. Be aggressive versus complacent about customer growth early.

3. Realize your customer channels are a primary asset of the company. Build new products or buy companies and push them down your sales channel.

4. Realize that your company will not be able to build everything itself. Buy more companies and push them down the channel."

Startups tend to succeed by building a product that is so compelling and differentiated that it causes large number of customers to adopt it over an incumbent. This large customer base becomes a major asset for the company going forward. Products can be cross sold to these customers, and the company's share of time or wallet can expand

One technique for improving your ideas is to think of sources of information as being in memetic buckets. If you listen to Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, and Sam Harris you're going to download many of the same ideas. If your idea inputs come from the same memetic bucket, your outputs will be in that bucket too. Your thoughts will be unifying with other people in that bucket, but they won‚Äôt be new or particularly interesting
