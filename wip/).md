Knowledge based work (intellectual endeavours) always begin from the body of work that came before it. The fact that [[Knowledge]]. Nothing can be built from a zero base. Ideas are born out of the hard work that you have already put in.

Develop ideas on paper while following your natural train of curiosity, [[Allow Yourself to Fall Down Rabbit Holes]] to build a body of externalised thought. By focusing on what is interesting you right now, writing it down and keeping track of it, new ideas will evolve naturally and without friction.

**All ideas need a catalyst.** Nothing comes from nothing. Why not have a body of work to build your ideas upon.

Review all the copy & pasted items in your note system. Write *your* ides and concepts on the work and throw the rest out. The archive is a bin for indecisive people. *Are you an archivst or a writer?*_

Every time you write a new note, make sure to go back to previous notes and to interlink them together. Orphan notes do not contribute to the serendipitous creation of new insights. Only by connecting notes together can we go from collector to creator.
