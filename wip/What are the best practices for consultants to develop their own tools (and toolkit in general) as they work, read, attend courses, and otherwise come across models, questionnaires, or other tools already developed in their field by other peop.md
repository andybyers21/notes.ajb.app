What are the best practices for consultants to develop their own tools (and toolkit in general) as they work, read, attend courses, and otherwise come across models, questionnaires, or other tools already developed in their field by other people?

* **Research** and [[TK - Take Scratch Notes]]. Keep a scrapboook of ideas - This could be a folder where you drop slides, figures, models, etc. Your scrapbook may consist of a few islands
* **Share** the ideas with others in order to achieve [[TK - Transparency]]. Consulting is based on an apprenticeship model, and part of the value you add as a consultant also applies to how you interact with colleagues. If you can filter out the best information and share nuggets of knowledge with your peers, this can help both parties to learn.
	* [[Writing about your ideas]] can help to flesh out your thinking. Createing an article about a key idea will help solidify your idas.
* **Use** what youâ€™ve learned to synthesize and create new ideas - Innovation can come from many directions. Sometimes you can apply a method used in one space into a totally new space. Sometimes streams of knowledge are separate and disjoint, and you may find a simpler more holistic way of combining the approaches. Or sometimes you can create models by creating a new relationship between the beholder and the model (e.g., such as creating a stakeholder value view instead of a shareholder value view).

In summary, Having a method to research, collect ideas, interact with the ideas, synthesize new creations, and share those creations is a meta process that works.
