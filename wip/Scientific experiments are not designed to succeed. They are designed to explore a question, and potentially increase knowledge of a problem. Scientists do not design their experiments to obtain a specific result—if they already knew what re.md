Scientific experiments are not designed to succeed. They are designed to explore a question, and potentially increase knowledge of a problem. Scientists do not design their experiments to obtain a specific result—if they already knew what result they would get, there would be no point in performing the experiment.

For scientists, every result is a new data point. Regardless of the outcome of the experiment, the findings will feed the learning wheel by helping refine—and sometimes eliminate—the original hypothesis.

How can this be applied to other areas of life / learning goals?

Replace imitation with exploration. Imitation feels safe. Many creatives and entrepreneurs stick to what they consider step-by-step playbooks from successful people. In some cases, it is possible to reproduce part of someone else’s success by applying a formula, but true breakthroughs never happen through pure imitation. Instead, take the road less traveled to explore new paths
