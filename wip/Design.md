In the film Objectified, the Japanese designer Naoto Fukasawa is interviewed. Out of the entire film, his interview was one of my favorites. And he sums up design concepts perfectly by using various metaphors — including a person who writes with a pen. (Watch the entire interview here.)

I'm embellishing a bit but basically he says that when a person is not thinking about themselves using the pen, the best writing occurs. Their creativity comes alive, and words flow through them with ease. Because if they are preoccupied with contemplating how to use the pen, that it's hurting their hand, and so forth — how can they produce possibly produce the best writing?

The point is: create tools that plug into natural human behavior. A person should be able to use a product without thought. And the product (or website) itself should never get in the way

this is how our websites or mobile apps should be: simply serve their purpose. That's it.
