* Focus on the Big Wins—the five to ten things that get you disproportionate results, including automating your savings and investing,
* Your friends and family will have lots of “tips” once you begin your financial journey. Listen politely, then stick to the program.
* Build a collection of “spending frameworks” to use when deciding on buying something. Most people default to restrictive rules (“I need to cut back on eating out . . .”), but you can flip it and decide what you’ll always spend on, like my book-buying rule: If you’re thinking about buying a book, just buy it. Don’t waste even five seconds debating it. Applying even one new idea from a book is worth it. (Like this one.)
* Beware of the endless search for “advanced” tips. So many people seek out high-level answers to avoid the real, hard work of improving step by step.
* Always Track Your Calls to Financial Companies Unfortunately for you, credit card companies are very good at using BS late fees to increase their revenues. Unfortunately for them, I’m giving you a script for getting these fees reversed (see What to Do If You Miss a Payment). One of the best ways to improve your chances of having fees waived is by keeping track of every call to your financial institutions, including credit card companies, banks, and investment companies. When I call to dispute anything, I open a spreadsheet that details the last time I called them, whom I spoke with, and what was resolved. If only criminals were as diligent as I am. Create a spreadsheet that looks like this: (?) Whenever you make a call regarding a dispute on your bill, you wouldn’t believe how powerful it is to refer back to the last time you called—citing the rep’s name, the date of the conversation, and your call notes. Most credit card reps you talk to will simply give in because they know you came to play in the big leagues. When you use this to confront a credit card company or bank with data from your last calls, you’ll be more prepared than 99 percent of other people—and chances are, you’ll get what you want.
* Manage debt to avoid damaging your credit score. “If you close an account but pay off enough debt to keep your credit utilization score the same,” says Craig Watts of FICO, “your score won’t be affected.” For example, if you carry $1,000 debt on two credit cards with a credit limit of $2,500 on each, your credit utilization rate is 20 percent ($1,000 debt, $5,000 total credit available). If you close one of the cards, suddenly your credit utilization rate jumps to 40 percent ($1,000, $2,500). But if you pay off $500 in debt, your utilization rate would be 20 percent ($500, $2,500), and your score would not change.
* Checking accounts are built for frequent withdrawals: They have debit cards and ATMs for your convenience. But your savings account is really a “goals” account, where every dollar is assigned to a specific item you’re saving up for, like a house, a vacation, or an emergency fund.
