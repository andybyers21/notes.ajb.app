* What are Evergreen notes? - Expand on this idea.

Write evergreen content - if you write content that stands the test of time, you’ll benefit from the ultimate Internet arbitrage. Google’s search algorithm will reward you as more and more people link to your article. The Internet will go to work for you 24 hours per day, seven days per week — and you won’t need to do any additional work.

By writing articles that stay relevant, you can reap the rewards of your hard work in the short-term for decades into the future.

"Even bad dramas are watched by thousands of people who don’t read reviews for a good few months. By contrast, most sports and news shows go stale after 24 hours, tops.

Write posts that will still be relevant in five years. Focus on timeless principles instead of what’s happening in the news.
