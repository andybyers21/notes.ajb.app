# Organisationsl Design
Organization Design is the process of shaping the way your business is run. How you organise and motivate your people will ultimately determine your success or failure. Avoid getting left behind and make the most of your top talent. Plan, build and implement organisational structures and ways of working that aid you in achieving your goals.

An organizational structure defines how activities such as task allocation, coordination, and supervision are directed toward the achievement of organizational aims. A well thought out organizational structure promotes action and provides the foundation on which your operating procedures and routines rest.

Organization Design – and redesign – can help any type of business achieve its goals. Sometimes, a large-scale reorganization is necessary. At other points, more subtle shifts in structures and systems can ensure you continue to thrive.

Our organisational design strategy will explore how your current organizational designs affect the people you work with. Norms, commitments, mind-sets, and networks are essential in getting things done. They represent and influence the ways people think, feel, communicate, and behave.

When these intangibles are not in sync with one another or the more tangible building blocks, the organization falters. We can show you how to build an organisation more conductive to foster these relationsjips and shit.

so that you are better able to recognize and respond to challenges and opportunities in the future.

Receive tailor-made strategies that keep ideas as simple and realistic as possible; that empower you to achieve your innovation and growth agendas.

You'll also need to check that all the necessary support functions are in place, and that you have a plan for successfully managing change.

Start-ups, you probably don't have org design but as you grow...

Your org-cahrt deosn't necessirly capture the way things get done. We will help you identify the informal lines and

the org chart is a peice of paper, you need to identify how people connect beyond lines and boxes. **Let the “lines and boxes” fit your company’s purpose.**

understand the organizational factors that had slowed down its responses in the past and build based on todays priorities

Design your organization so that it’s easy for people to be accountable for their part of the work without being micromanaged. Make sure that decision rights are clear and that information flows rapidly and clearly from the executive committee to business units, functions, and departments.

establish clear decision rights and motivators more in tune with the company’s desired goals.

Build on your strengths. Overhauling the organization is one of the hardest things for a chief executive or division leader to do, especially if he or she is charged with turning around a poorly performing company. But there are always strengths to build on in existing practices and in the culture.

good Organization Design involves not only changing the systems by which people work, but also supporting people to adapt successfully.
