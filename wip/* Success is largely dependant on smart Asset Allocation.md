* **Success is largely dependant on smart [[Asset Allocation]]**
* Investing is a zero sum game (like poker). There is a finite amount of assets in the market. If one person is buying then the other must be selling, therefor one must win & one must lose. But as the market changes it is possible for everyone to create welth. One of the most fundamental rules for achieving long-term financial success is that you need to get in the market and stay in it, so you can capture all of its gains.
* **Aim for 20% of net income saved/ invested each month.** Do the sums. If this is too high start from 10 or 15.
* **Stay away from banks, debt markets, pension funds and other financial institutions** - stick with physical businesses.
* Avoid Brokers like the clap. - Excessive fees can destroy up to two-thirds of your investment over the long term. **You’ve got to look very carefully at the small print.**
---* Have a percentage of (low) income producing investments (bonds etc.) that you can sell in a bear market and buy bargain price stocks (indexes).
* Different opportunities will always present themselves, depending on the economic climate or market behaviour.
* You’re never going to know the right time to buy anything. But if you keep adding to your investments systematically over months and years, you’ll reduce your risk and increase your returns over time.
