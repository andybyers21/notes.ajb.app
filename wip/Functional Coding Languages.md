# Functional Coding Languages

It’s interesting to note that there exist functional programming languages, like Scala or Erlang that forbid changing variable values. unlike javascript

In such languages, once the value is stored “in the box”, it’s there forever. If we need to store something else, the language forces us to create a new box (declare a new variable). We can’t reuse the old one.

Though it may seem a little odd at first sight, these languages are quite capable of serious development. More than that, there are areas like parallel computations where this limitation confers certain benefits. Studying such a language (even if you’re not planning to use it soon) is recommended to broaden the mind.
