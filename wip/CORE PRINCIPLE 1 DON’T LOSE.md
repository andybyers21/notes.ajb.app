# CORE PRINCIPLE 1: DON’T LOSE
#tk/wealth

* The first question that every great investor asks constantly is this: “How can I avoid losing money?” This may sound counterintuitive. After all, most of us focus on exactly the opposite question: “How can I make money? How do I get the biggest possible return and hit the jackpot?”

* the best investors are obsessed with avoiding losses. Why? Because they understand a simple but profound fact: the more money you lose, the harder it is to get back to where you started.

* If you invested $100,000 and you lost 50%, you now have $50,000. If you then make a 50% return on that $50,000, you now have a total of $75,000. You’re still down $25,000. In reality, you’ll need a 100% gain just to recoup your losses and get back to your original $100,000. And that could easily take you an entire decade.

* his entire investment approach is built on his awareness that the market will sometimes outsmart him, veering in a totally unexpected direction.

* It simply means that we should invest in ways that help to protect us from nasty surprises.

* I now tell all my advisors, “Don’t even bring me an investment idea unless you first tell me how we can protect against or minimize the downside.”
