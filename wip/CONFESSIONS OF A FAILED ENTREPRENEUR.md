Never trying because of fear is the true failure. You can fail and keep trying, that's not failure, it's a part of process in achievement. 

## FORMAT NOTES
Start typing your first paragraph immediately. Then, if you used a subtitle, go back and insert an extra line break above. Your first paragraph of each section should not be indented. Every following paragraph should have an indent of half an inch. “Dialogue,” she said, “is also indented one half inch. It is still in the ‘Body’ paragraph style.”
Your next paragraphs will be indented. For long quotes of more than 99 words, or letters from characters, choose either of those styles from the left. Just remember to add an extra space between the body text and the quoted text.

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat."

A letter will have the same style, only it will be italicized.
Designate a section or scene change with one # symbol centered in the middle of the page. Choose the “Chapter Subtitle” style so that your next paragraph won’t be indented.

Your next paragraph should automatically switch to “Body No Indent” as the following paragraph style. And the paragraph after this will be “Body” with an indent.
Insert a page break after each chapter.

[After the page break, hit enter 5 times before switching to the “Chapter Title” style]

## PREFACE
Most books focus on success. But success is a poor teacher. These books focus on how things went wrong and what we can learn from failure.
When I was little i used to tell people I would be a millionaire when I grew up. I didn't know why and i didnt know how. It was probably because my parents wouldn't let me have a Super Nintendo AND a SEGA. Regardless there must have been something in that statement. Later on, when I was asked about what I wanted to be when I grew up I said I’d “run my own business” or “be a business man.” When I was asked what in I didnt have an answer. Everyone i knw wanted to be a soilder or a doctor or something.

Stuff about selling dodgy CD’s and playstation games

Why did i write this book? They say X business fail in the first year. List some reasons. All comes down to learning from failure. To learn from my failures. Something, as you will see ive not done so well at so far. - stuff about failure RESEARCH biggest disadvantage I had writing this book is that I'm not a successful entrapunrr. I would only read people who have the province to back it up.

What I am an expert in though is failure and this is the lessons learned.

As you read you will see common themes in each chapter. - A note abouit how the book is structured.
Had difficulty writing because I was embarrassed by my failures.

"What we've got here is failure to communicate,"
-Strother Martin, Cool Hand Luke

In any collaboration, one of the greatest challenges that can arise is change. Of course, our ideas and projects must evolve with the feedback and realizations we gain over the course of development. While we must remain open to change, we must also ensure that changes are introduced at the right time and for the right reasons. Change can get us off track very easily.
What was started as a group of [misfits] who found common ground in their love for Volkswagens. DubNorthEast quickly turned sour when it became apparent one of the team members wasn’t a team player. Initially it was a group of people holding regular meets when we decided we need a way to communicate and share information outwith these one or two hours a week. (These were the days before [instant messenger] remember.
One of the group had some web-dev skills so we all pitched in for hosting and our forum was born. There was teh web guy, a branding and merch guy and an events manager. I became de facto project manager for the team. Word of mouth took the project off the ground and soon our weekly meets of five or six became fifty to sixty and the website was 1000 plus members.
Spurned on by initial success I took a look at the competition and developed a strong vision for where I wanted the group to go. We were to put on a show and open our own [custom car garage].
The problem among especially passionate leaders is that their vision; and their obsession with perfection (or control), often allows micromanagement to get the better of them. This happens for the best of reasons: We care deeply about both the process and the end product.

Partners/ relationships/ communication
Relationships gone sour.
Started as a hobby with friends. I took charge and made it a business when it shouldnt necessaraly should have been.
Plans to go super big (garage etc) started gaining traction. Then left due to circumstances

Maybe this is a chapter about partners and how I had the wrong ones which made me not want any in the future.
It’s no secret that it is easier to succeed in business with the right partners and the right relationships. Something we’ll touch on later on in the book. The wrong business partner will, at the very least hurt, or, at worst, destroy your company. Was I the wrong partner and should have stepped away earlier to let the business grow and breath.
if you fail to share ownership, you’ll also fail to get those around you to care. This is not about money; it’s about mentality. Having only one person stay up at night thinking about how to solve a problem or capitalize on a particular opportunity is frankly not enough. You need to engage your team as owners by sharing credit, sharing responsibility, and sharing financial rewards. Something I was woefully unaware of at the time.
Judge and Be Judged Amidst Conflict There is a saying: “You don’t know who is swimming naked until the tide goes out.” It is only when things go wrong that we are able to see what’s truly going on beneath the surface. While conflict is never pleasant, as leaders we must acknowledge that conflict provides a precious opportunity to judge the leadership capability of others. Admired leaders use conflict in two ways. The first is to evaluate the reasoning and patience of their partners or superiors. As soon as something goes wrong, they watch and learn. If you are ever unsure about the true chemistry and potential of a team, use conflict as an opportunity to measure it. Whether you are judging the leadership capability of your superiors, peers, or clients, performance during conflict is revealing. The second way leaders use conflict is to build confidence and earn their team’s respect. A number of accomplished CEOs, creative directors, and other leaders I have met attribute the greatest leaps in their careers to a crisis that they solved. It was less about the actual deal or decision that was made and more about the process of resolving conflict. They encouraged their teams to step back and regain perspective, to quit blaming and start brainstorming solutions. When their teams were plagued with doubt and uncertainty, these leaders seized the opportunity to combat apathy and rally their teams toward a solution. Naturally, amidst the anxieties associated with conflict, people are most impressionable when something goes wrong. Thoughtful leaders use conflict as an opportunity to align and strengthen their teams.

We had a garage, i walked and left everything i had invested in the company before we finished the show. I’m sorry to say that the show didn’t go ahead that year but I’m pleased to note, that at the time of writing at least, the business is still running sucessfully. With a whole new leadership team at the helm doing what it should have been the first time round. [Being a community…. Etc. etc] 

## (2) OFFSHORE CLEANING CO BUSINESS PLAN
Life, new baby etc got in the way

Chapter 1, let me wait until this… let me wait until that….

Maybe make this the first chapter then we can get more into the themes further down. Need to make a big splash to start though.

Discuss that I no longer wanted a partner and the last one fucked me over. I learned the wrong lesson. Thought better to go alone rather than find a good one early in this chapter.

First try but didn’t even get off the ground when….

Lack of focus – Without focus, your business will lose it the competitive edge. It is impossible to have a broad strategy on a startup budget. What makes startups succeed is their ability to quickly pivot, and the lack of focus leads to the inability to make the necessary adjustments. 

# (3) HSPL SOLUTIONS
Working On the business not in the business

Probably something about finances/ tax. Didnt understand finances, Didnt take advice, Thought I knew better than the pros. Contract ended. Didn’t know what to do next - got scared. Got a job.

This was my chance. After working in the oil industry for some time came the opportunity for a short inspection project. It seemed simple from the outside, here’s my chance to get a foot in the door of the business world and it was. That small project led to many others and about 18 months of solid work. I was riding high. My first “real business” was going well. So well in fact that we hired our first staff member within 6 months.

I did some research, got the business incorporated, got some insurance, registered as an employer and away we went.  I was working hard at what I knew, inspection, and the money came in. The bills were paid and [food was on the table]. If you want to run a successful business you have to know how to play to your strengths. I was a model employee. [Driving cross-country doing stuff]. But who was working on the business? When it came to the end of the year and the dreaded letter from the tax man came I didn’t have a clue.

But here came the problem which came rushing up to meet me full force. I was working hard IN my business. Working in your business requires that you have developed a certain level of skill performing the technical and mechanical aspects of your chosen profession. Working in your business means you are the force that creates revenue for your company. Which is exactly what I thought business was about. I was doing all the [buzz wordy] things:
* meeting with clients and making sales
* processing orders and paying vendors
* doing paperwork and invoicing
* wearing 17 hats and have dozens of things going on simultaneously

Working on your business allows you to grow your company to the point that your business can create revenue even if you aren’t there. Working on your business means you are:
developing a plan to grow your business beyond what it is now
putting the right people on your team
learning about new products or services you can offer
marketing your business to find new clients and expand your market share
Working on your business requires that you go beyond the activities that make up your daily to-do list or appointment calendar. It requires that you either learn (or hire someone) to handle the areas of marketing, branding, budgeting, product pricing, bookkeeping and so on. It requires that you develop processes and procedures to handle situations like hiring, firing, customer service issues, and employee training.
Working in your business means you are “spending time” doing the mundane things you have to do each day.
Working on your business means you are “investing time” to make your business better than it is today.
So, how do you transition from working in your business to working on your business?

“Learn to work harder on yourself than you do on your job. If you work hard on your job you can make a living, but if you work hard on yourself you’ll make a fortune.”
-Jim Rohn

After the disaster that was HSPL Solutions I was loathe to take another consulting gig. But then, through a shared connection there came an opportunity that I couldn’t refuse. The commute was long and it meant being away from home for long periods but the payoff was a well paying job with plenty time off.
Lessons had been learned, I would hire the best accountant I could to handle my affairs. More on that later [later on talk about accountant who was recommended as a relative of a friend/ mentor who turned out bad. Do your due diligence]
It paid very well, but the gig was a disaster. Everything was in chaos. No one could get anything done. We were at the complete mercy of overseas directors and [HSEQ? Who takes ownership of unsafe platforms/ jobs] who were battling for control of the company. Office politics was at an all time high and the revolving merry-go-round of senior management didn’t lend itself well to [employee morale / company culture] lets just say that internal communications was not [the best].
Thomas, as we’ll call him, had helped lead a number of start-ups and had dealt with his share of ego-driven CEOs. “It is pretty predictable,” he explained. “When ideas prove to be great, the CEO takes tremendous pride. When things are rough, it becomes a blame game.” Then his demeanor stiffened a bit and he further qualified his statement: “We have a great CEO. A real creative guy. But he thrives on his success and only truly recognizes the role of our team when dealing with.
In an ideal world, managers would constantly be thinking about how to best utilize their people—and clients would always unearth your greatest potential. Unfortunately, the reality is that bosses and clients are as worried about their own careers as you are about your own.
I was frustrated, after I ran into a brick wall time and time again, it was like learned helplessness. What could I do? I’m just a contractor here and if they don’t want my help I’ll just sit there and collect my checks while I waited for my contract to end.

I recently read a piece of advice the author Robert Greene. “There are two types of time: alive time and dead time. One is when you sit around, when you wait until things happen to you. The other is when you are in control, when you make every second count, when you are learning and improving and growing.” Unbeknowns I chose the latter.
As he said, “The worst thing in life you can have is a job that you hate, that you have no energy in, that you’re not creative with and you’re not thinking of the future. To me, might as well be dead.”
This does not mean you should quit your job immediately if you don’t love it. What Robert did during those years greatly influenced his writing. He wasn’t dead in those dead-end jobs; he was alive — researching, learning, studying, and observing the forces he would document in 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, Mastery, and The Laws of Human Nature.
So I decided I would make the absolute most of every moment while I was stuck in L.A.
I could not control what was going on with the board of directors, but I could choose how to spend my days. I decided to make the next several months a kind of work-study program. I was going to learn everything I could about people, about myself, about the factors that had created this crisis. I was also going to fill every nonworking second with productive reading and research.
As frustrated as I was with that consulting gig, it was actually the perfect place for me to research and meditate on that book I was thinking about writing. (You could say the obsacle was the way.)
Life is constantly asking us, Is this going to be alive time or dead time?
A long commute. Are we going to zone out or listen to an audiobook?
A delayed flight. Are we going to get in a couple of miles by walking around the terminal or shove a Cinnabon into our face?
A tour of duty or a contract we have to earn out. Is this tying us down or freeing us up?
That’s our call.
We think the future is something that happens, rather than something we make.
In Ego, I told the story of Malcolm Little. In 1946 he was arrested for trying to fence an expensive watch he’d stolen. In his apartment, police found jewelry, furs, an arsenal of guns, and all his burglary tools. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He could have served his time simply counting the days. He could have planned his next crime spree. Instead, he started reading. He literally copied the dictionary word for word. Every minute he wasn’t in his bunk, he was in the library. That was how Malcolm Little was transformed into Malcolm X.
Why did Malcolm X wear glasses? Because he literally wore his eyes out reading in prison.
But the trade-off was worth it. Those five years he served were some of the most productive of his life. He breathed in every second while his fellow prisoners rotted away.
So many people are busy thinking about the future that they miss the opportunities right in front of them. We think the future is something that happens, rather than something we make.
We think, This is just a job; this is just a crappy couple of [months, minutes, weeks]. It doesn’t matter. We tell ourselves that we’re just doing this to pay for school or because we have to. That no good can come out of it, except the direct deposit every two weeks.
Like Robert says, if you’re going to think like that, you might as well be dead. Your mind apparently is.
We have to choose to make every moment a moment of alive time. We have to decide to be present. To make the most of whatever is in front of us.
Might it be better if we were totally free; if we weren’t stuck in traffic or at the airport or on some dumb assignment from our idiot boss? Sure. But we aren’t.
So what are we going to do about it? We are going to find some advantage.
Pick up a book. Pick up a pen. Pick up the phone.
Open your eyes. Open your ears. Open your mind.
There is plenty you can get out of this. Plenty you can do to make this productive, purposeful time—even if the situation is not completely in your control.
Resist the temptation to let silly politics or wanderlust distract you. Resist the resentment or the despondency. These things won’t help you. Only hunger and determination will.
In the 1960s, French political protesters used the slogan Vivre sans temps mort (live without wasted time). That’s what great leaders and artists have done, even in terrible conditions like a prison sentence, an exile, a bear market or a depression, military conscription, even being sent to a concentration camp (see Viktor Frankl). Through their attitude and approach, they transformed their circumstances into something that fueled greatness.
They asked themselves, alive time or dead time? They answered with their actions. Can you?
As they say, this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it?

Nothing is more priceless than time, so never waste this precious gift. It takes time to bring value to the marketplace, but we get paid for the value, not the time. So it’s what you do with your time that really matters. I’ve never met a rich man who didn’t value his time, and I’ve never met a poor man who did. Learn to see the value of time because, with time, anything can be accomplished. I often laugh at those who hate on successful people when they have the same 24 hours in a day and the same opportunities.

Bottom line: It’s better to give before you receive. And never keep score. If your interactions are ruled by generosity, your rewards will follow suit.

(5) SNOWBOARDS -
Listening to other peoples bullshit
Social Experiment
Loistening to other peoples bullshit, it only takes 5% doubt to put you down even when you don’t believe what the other person is telling you. Even when your fired up that 5% will put you down. That niggling doubt.
It was time to make a step away from the oil industry at this point. Clearly the consulting world wasn’t for me. In an effort to [distract my brain] I decided to carry out a social expreiment of sorts. No targets, no deadlines, no [fixed-terms?]. After the previous fuck-ups i’d gone back to a full time job and was stagnating in an office cubicle.This was an effort scratch the itch while not having to worry about paying the bills.
The plan was simple.  

(6) NORTH EAST L.R. SPARES
Taking advice -
Learned from the other peoples bullshit lesson then over applied it here. Didn’t take the right advice. Didn’t listen to anyone.
We started North East Land Rover Spares (yeah, it’s a bit of a mouth full) out of necessity. My contract at Fabex had ended and rather than using the “dead-time” as an opportunity to advance the business and advance myself [it was wasted, what did i do?]. When the call finally came it was’nt unexpected but I was totally unprepared.
I was [bad view??] of the consulting industry and decided it was time to escape that rat-race once and for all.
The opportunity was clear. the community of enthusasts was well established both locally and online and we were located right in the centre of a farming community, one of our number 1 target markets.
We had a small yard and a number of products on hand already so we set-up an ebay store and got to dismantling. What advice was i given here?
This was another mistake I made with my first store. I didn’t put much effort into content marketing, which made getting organic and social traffic very difficult, especially with something as innocuous as reusable bags. I rectified this mistake with the second store, which was built with content marketing as the foundation.
Something about free vs paid marketing and i didn’t do either
Here’s the thing about taking advice. [Giving a 7]
 

(7) BLASTING CO. 1
Boredom in execution
(Horizion Blasting) Always looking for the next big thing. Ref: notes in Making Ideas Happen
The oppertunity/ niche was there. Make sure this is discussed in an earlier chapter.

Didn’t think it was big enough
No finances to start

(10) C.V WRITING / BUSINESS PLANS ETC.
Underdog Syndrome
Belief in own skills
Overwhelmed, business as successful because we had too much work. Didn’t know how to set prices, didn’t believe in charging more for my work. Felt like a fraud. Afraid of scaring customers away. Didn’t believe in own skills.

Wasn’t willing to spend the money -  

(9) VENTURAS
Goals and values
Brand identity in docs
Didn’t have clearly defined goals that I believed in. The were only there to look good in the business plan.
Core values – Your core values are the fundamental beliefs that drive your business. They are your guiding principles that should remain constant. Even as your company grows your core values should remain the same. Core values can also serve as a moral compass. Some of the more common core values are integrity, trust, excellence, respect, responsibility, and teamwork.
Don’t allow your core values to become empty words, make them part of your culture.
This was it, the culmination of all the previous lessons learned. This was the big one. Our forever business. The reasons had changed. It wasn’t about money but building something we love. Something
In the end, enthusiasm is not enough to succeed. It takes much more than that. You need to research your market, your competition, the financial feasibility of your concept, and more. As you fight through the battles of making your dream come true, you need to be able to go back to read and re-read your business plan. The concepts laid down in your business plan will help you to convince your bank to give you the loan you need, or to determine the best marketing strategy for your business. Don’t be emotional when you prepare your business plan. Treat it as a business process with goals and deliverables. Once you complete it, ask yourself, “Would I invest in this company?” Remember, you are going to have to convince others to support your idea. Bankers, corporate buyers, investors, partners, and the like will look at your business based on facts. Their decision is not going to be based on emotion. When creating a written business plan you give yourself a chance to think about your idea thoroughly. As you put your ideas in writing, you tend to give them more thought. You might think writing a business plan is boring, or a waste of time. Truly, it should be one of the most exciting projects you could ask for. You are writing your future.
Discuss what we learned from previous stuff
Write down your goals. Keep your goals in front of you and keep coming back to them, at least once a month.

 

(14) CATCH 21
Work Ethic? Over planning/ under executing
Is this an over arching narrative, the last piece of the puzzle
Bit about getting up, scheduling etc. Writing this at 6am every morning practice

 

(15) CONCLUSION

“No matter what one does, regardless of failure or success, the experience is a form of success in itself.”
-Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba

(As I said in the intro)
Prepare to fail – Do not fear failure. There is one thing for sure, you will fail before you succeed. Expect failure but don’t fear it. Think of it as a normal part of your business. It is necessary. It is good for your business. It teaches you. It helps you make the right decision the next time. It is super important that you don’t associate failure with quitting. Only those that take action fail and only those that take action succeed.
Conclusion. Reading and writing has stuck with me for years while persuiing these ?(sometimes) crazy ideas.
Outline the market fit for writing/ publishing.
Maybe something about a decentralised business. See the file in drive - few distributed or something like that.
Wrote the book to explore my own failures and what they mean to me. What lessons can we learn here. What have we learned here? Wrote this to Adjust the narrative. Use my failures instead of them using me
Whats next? Maybe centre this chapter around the idea of a publishing co. We’ve networked while promoting the book. We’ve learned the process. Discuss each of the themes in context.
