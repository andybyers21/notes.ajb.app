* overthinking is the downfall of all great ideas
* Winners focus on action, not consumption. It’s like dancing. You don’t learn to dance by sitting at the bar creepily analyzing people’s moves — you actually have to get up and give it a try. - “Would I pay for this?” Next time you are binge watching something or screwing around on social media, ask yourself “is this something I enjoy so much I would spend money on it?” If not, find something you would.
* Replace the words “I don’t have time” with “it’s not a priority for me.” Go ahead, see what happens.
* “In a billion dollar company, the employees aren’t working any harder than people in a million dollar company. They’re just doing the right things/.” - Naval Ravikant

1. Know what to skip. When you get a thorny challenge, ask yourself if you actually need to do that at all. In some cases, it’s not a real need and can be dropped. In others, you may find a side goal that’s a better choice.

* The best way to use those 5 minutes of downtime every day

* Cut your deadlines in half. Every time you have something to do and you catch yourself saying, “I’m going to do that by next month,” instead ask yourself, “why can’t I do that in half the time?”

Our focus is severely limited, and when we try to execute multiple tasks at any one time it quickly goes into overdrive, severely limiting your capacity to make informed decisions. We become agitated, confused, and nothing gets done at the end. To get things done quickly, effectively, do one thing at oat time. Then move on to the next.
