When you [[Allow Yourself to Fall Down Rabbit Holes]] ideas will form organically. The more you link your notes the better chances of this happening.

The search for links between notes is a chore **BUT** It is absolutely essential to developing meaningful connected thought processes.

When possible every note should have at least three types of links:
* **A link to a more general idea** or another subject. (Use § links if possible if you [[Create Outlines as You Write Notes]] this will connect your ides to the wider web of your second brain). *If you’re writing about the diet of guinea pigs you might link to the nutritional requirements of rodents in general.*
* **A link to a more specific idea,** direct links. *Here you could link to protein requirements of guinea pigs.*
* **A link to a related topic.** A lateral leap — guinea pigs as pets, alternate meanings of “guinea pig”, an article on “is a guinea pig a pig?”
