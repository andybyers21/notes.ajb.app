[[Knowledge]]

[[TK - Take Scratch Notes]] first and regurlary any time an idea hits you. You may throw 90% of these in the bin but these **seeds** are required to [[Grow Your Digital Gardens]]. A tree may drop 100 acorns but only one will grow into a mighty oak.

(I have no idea if acorns grow into oak trees but it's a good analogy.)

Information only becomes knowledge when we put it to good use. **Let your information intermingle to create new ideas**

Add concrete facts **in your own words**, use direct quotes extremely sparingly unless they REALLY resonate.

Stop searching for the *right* bit of knowledge. Remove all barriers to entry and follow what interests you in the moment. Create [[Allow Yourself to Fall Down Rabbit Holes]]. Remember, your second brain is for you and you only so if a thread about pokemon intermingles with business strategy nobody needs to know. And who knows what insight could come from it.

Create a web of idea by linking notes densely and allowing unseen connections to form. [[Creating a Web of Ideas & Note Linking]]

Chase those threads that bring enjoyment and enlightenment. Do not waste time forward planning on things that you will not follow through on.

Remember: Notes should be flexible, well titled, [[Why Positive Note Titles Are Important]], concept-oriented building blocks without friction. They should be densely populated with links to other notes and related ideas. But don't fret if you can't find a link immediately. Let them grow organically.
