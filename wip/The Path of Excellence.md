# The Path of Excellence
Using all of my experience, knowledge, and quad-ruled engineering paper; I developed what would become known as The Path of Excellence.

Note that it's the path “to” excellence. There is no destination. The path itself is excellence. It has six parts:

1. Frame (Think)
2. Prepare
3. Commit
4. Do
5. Feedback
6. Turnover

If you’re on the Path of Excellence, you can stop worrying: You are doing the right thing, at the right time, with the right amount of energy. You experience more flow, which means a better experience, better skill development, and better results.

Simple, but beyond powerful.

When I’ve been the most fulfilled, I’ve been walking the Path of Excellence. When I’ve felt anxious, overwhelmed, depressed, or unsatisfied; I find myself off the path.

* Example: I went from Think to Do, skipping Prepare and Commit. Without Prepare or Committing, I felt the lack of assuredness in my actions because I worried if I was doing the right thing, and if there were other, most important/pressing, things I could/should be doing.
