# Some Dev notes


- **C#** A return inside of a code block will short circuit the code and “return” out of the method, wherever it is placed.
- `—-i`, the check happens before the rest of a statement is evaluated
- `i++`, the check happens after the statement has been evaluated
- A semicolon `;` is effectively opening and closing curly brackets `{ }`
