There will always be at least one factor that will constrain your workflow. Be it an app's missing feature, processing power or ... 

However, I propose that these constraints of the tools you use are a benefit, not a hindrance.

Maybe it's there for a reason, more constraints means more lightweight apps, means faster performance and faster workflows for you. 

So I’ve found this to be really good for reducing some of the barriers for getting things done.

[[TK - Systems and Features of Good Note Taking Tools]]
>- The restraints of software is a feature not a bug. Learn to work within the constraints.
>- Having local notes instead of proprietry databases.

> I've found that the simplest tools tend to result in the most innovative work. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, as most people assume a tool with the most features will yield the highest value. However, due to the paradox of choice, it's easy to get overwhelmed by too many options. This directly compromises our ability to be creative.  

I’m of the opinion now that overly designed and overly clean notetaking setups are inherently less useful. 

[[Rework]]
>Embrace constraints “I don’t have enough time/money/people/experience.” Stop whining. Less is a good thing. Constraints are advantages in disguise. Limited resources force you to make do with what you’ve got. There’s no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative. Ever seen the weapons prisoners make out of soap or a spoon? They make do with what they’ve got. Now we’re not saying you should go out and shank somebody—but get creative and you’ll be amazed at what you can make with just a little.

>What could you be doing instead? What can’t you do because you’re doing this? This is especially important for small teams with constrained resources. That’s when prioritization is even more important. If you work on A, can you still do B and C before April? If not, would you rather have B and C instead of A? If you’re stuck on something for a long period of time, that means there are other things you’re not getting done.

In 2004, Jeff Bezos officially banned the use of PowerPoint at Amazon.

~~~There are many different forms of note-taking, and everyone swears that their method is “the one to rule them all.” I’ve tried a handful of these methods: hand-written notes, drawn notes, Word documents, etc. My issue with these methods is that I spend most of my time formatting my notes while not focusing on the meeting. I needed to find a method that was low-fidelity, but organized enough to write meaningful notes quickly.

You read something in a book, or you hear something in a meeting, or you have some experience in your life and you want to remember it. So you write it down. Maybe you write it in a paper notebook, or maybe you write it in a note-taking system.

As you’re writing, a nagging feeling pops up: where do I put this? You want to put this golden nugget of information somewhere that you’ll find it again. You want to put it somewhere that it will be useful when you need it.

But the problem is: when? When will you need it? You can’t predict. You can’t predict, so you don’t know where to put it. 

Should you put it in the notebook of the project it’s most directly related to? Should you file it under your book notes? Should you file it away under the author’s name? Or maybe under the subject?

The possibilities are endless and overwhelming. 

So you satisfice. You stick it somewhere and forget about it. You do that over and over again. Soon, your Evernote, Notion, and Apple Notes all become a black hole of unread and totally forgotten notes. 

The nagging feeling persists, though you try to ignore it. Your life becomes gray, and lifeless. You dream of something more. 

But then a sort of Morpheus enters your life. Except his name is Conor, and he’s invented a way to solve your problem. It’s called Roam. All you have to do is take a pill, forsake all of your old ideas of notetaking, and live your life anew.

You take the pill, and suddenly everything is different. The nagging feeling is gone. You never have to ask yourself where to put something again, because the answer is PUT IT EVERYWHERE.

No Vendor Lock-In

Notes and attachments are simply stored on your disk, this is extremely portable and powerful: you could edit your notes with your favorite editor, have them synchronized via Dropbox, run Git on them, run a regex-based search and replace on them etc.

Zen Mode

Zen mode provides a minimalistic editing and reading experience, hiding everything that's not necessary.

### 5 steps in the Theory of Constraints
- Identify the bottleneck
- Exploit the bottleneck
- Align with and support the constraint.
- Elevate the performance of the constraint - If the constraint still exists, you will need to make it a higher priority.
- Repeat the process

 Consider this: A developer might spend half a day working on a script that makes his workflow faster. Saving three seconds every time he runs a thing. A process he runs, on average, 20 times a day. This all adds up:

3 seconds x 20 times a day = 1 minute
1 minute x 5 day's a week = 5 minutes 
*I'm sure you can see where this is going.*
It would take this guy 10 weeks to get that 4 hours back. Was it really worth the effort?

Wouldn't he have been better off learning the keyboard shortcut for this which would take about, oh, 3 seconds. 

## Focus your content

## Decision fatigue

## My simplified workflow
i've even binned my calendar. It's only purpose is to alert me of meetings that other people have invited me too. I never ever look at it.

[[Day 7 - Tools]]
> - the tools you should use. Constraints of rhe tools are a benefit. Learn to work within them etc.   
> - More/ better technology does not = more productivity  

> Use the tools that maximise your wokflow. For exapmpe, obsidian for a master database. 1writer (or whtever) for quick capture. Reviewing your notes on your phone is not so productive  
### Text
This includes alll writing, note taking etc.
Obsidioan 
Everything but email which I'm still looking for a solution for 

Apps like obsidian and roam remove the need to organise your files.... ==Expand==

### Web Dev
I've binned off wordpress etc, too many features and bloat 
Jekyll + Atom editor + Terminal. That's it.

I could go further and merge my Obsidian workflow with Atom editor but there's a couple of features that I would miss. 

#### Owning your files. 

If I have files for notes and writing as (hard copies?) on my computer I can easily push them to another folder which will update my website which I also have in hard copy

- - - -
When chosing your apps you'll probably consider what the key features are you need. But also thisnk about what you don't need. Do I need formatting options when I'm taking notes. Probably not. Will I play with formatting options when I use this software? Probably.
