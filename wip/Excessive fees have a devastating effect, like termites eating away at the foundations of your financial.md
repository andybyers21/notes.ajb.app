Excessive fees have a devastating effect, like termites eating away at the foundations of your financial

* Compounded, the high costs of investment fees can confiscate an astounding 70% of your lifetime returns!
* 
* Be hyper aware of fund fees (and dividends) prior to making any purchase decision.
* The largest expense in your life is taxes, and paying more than you need to pay is insane—especially when it’s absolutely avoidable! If you’re not careful, taxes can have a catastrophic impact on your returns.

What I’ve found over almost four decades of studying success is that the most successful people in any field aren’t just lucky. They have a different set of beliefs. They have a different strategy. They do things differently than everyone else.

* The key is to recognize these consistently successful patterns and to model them, using them to guide the decisions you make in your own life. These patterns provide the playbook for your success.

* CORE PRINCIPLE 3: TAX EFFICIENCY

* taxes can easily wipe out 30% or more of your investment returns if you’re not careful.

* there’s only one number that truly matters: the net amount that you actually get to keep.

* In investing, self-delusion is an expensive habit.

* Simply by being smart about your holding period, you’re saving

* Believe me, all the billionaires I’ve ever met have one attribute in common: they and their advisors are really smart about taxes! They know that it’s not what they earn that counts. It’s what they keep. That’s real money, which they can spend, reinvest, or give away to improve the lives of others.

* there’s nothing sordid or immoral about managing your finances in ways that lawfully reduce your tax burden.

* Federal Appeals Court Judge Billings Learned Hand. He famously stated in 1934: “Anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible…. Nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands.”

* steer clear of actively managed funds, especially those that trade a lot. As David told me, one benefit of index funds is that they keep trading to a minimum, which means “your tax bill is going to be lower. This is huge. One of the most serious problems in the mutual fund industry, which is full of serious problems, is that almost all mutual fund managers behave as if taxes don’t matter. But taxes matter. Taxes matter a lot.”

* The enormous impact of taxes on your returns “speaks to the importance of taking advantage of every tax-advantaged investment opportunity that you can,”

* You should take every opportunity to invest in a tax-deferred way.”

* you’re not maximizing your contributions, now is the time to do it!

* Whenever someone tells me about a financial opportunity that seems to offer enticing returns, my response is always the same: “Is that net?”

* the pretax figure is phony, whereas the net number doesn’t lie.

* Your goal, and mine, is always to maximize the net.
