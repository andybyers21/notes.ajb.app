# Methods

**Methods are reusable units of work in a self contained code-block.** In C-Sharp every statement is executed within a method. Methods are blocks of code that carry out a single, pre-defined function. They can be defined inside of [[Classes]], structures and interfaces.

[[Access Modifiers]] controls access to methods. ^[Defaults to private if not defined.]

- `=>` Arrow functions should not be used for methods.
- Methods should end with arguments`()`.
- Methods should be named in PaschalCase.

[[Object Oriented Programming]]

```
