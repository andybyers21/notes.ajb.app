# Boolean

## (true/false logical type)

The boolean type has only two values. `true` or `false`. It is typically used to store yes/no values. For example:

```js
let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
```

And also comes as a result of comparisons

```js
let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert(isGreater); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
```
