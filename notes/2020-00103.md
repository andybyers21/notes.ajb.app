# Methods

**Methods are reusable units of work in a self contained code-block.** In C-Sharp every statement is executed within a method. Methods are blocks of code that carry out a single, pre-defined function. They can be defined inside of [[Classes]], structures and interfaces.

[[Access Modifiers]] controls access to methods. ^[Defaults to private if not defined.]

- `=>` Arrow functions should not be used for methods.
- Methods should end with arguments`()`.
- Methods should be named in PaschalCase.

[[Object Oriented Programming]]

### Calling a Method

Calling the method WriteLine inside of the class Console:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
// Class.Method("Statement")
```

* [[Literals]]
	* All [[Simple Types]], by default, have the [[Methods]] `.ToString()` which returns the fully qualified name of the type of the Object.
* [[Parsing]]
	* **The parse [[Methods]] is specific in that it only converts Strings to other types.** (Use the `ToString()` method to convert other types to strings). (See: [[Handling strings in C-Sharp]]). The purpose of `.Parse` is to make a string representation of other types.
