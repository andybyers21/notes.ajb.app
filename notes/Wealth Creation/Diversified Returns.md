# Diversified Returns

Investment does not relate specifically to the stock market, you could invest in anything that you think will have an upward trajectory or percentage return. **Find those items that offer the lowest risk/ highest return.** Diversification is an admission that you don’t know which particular asset class, stock or bond (or which country) will do best. So own a bit of everything

Think in terms of what offers the best returns. You do not need to be tied to [[Stock Markets]]. For example, the help to save account (UK only), if you are eligible, offers a guranteed return rate of 50% over 4 years. Beat that in the market! **Look for opportunities everywhere,** low risk, high reward.

Avoid putting all your money in real estate, stocks, bonds, or any single investment class. Diversify within asset classes. Don’t put all your money in a favorite stock such as Apple, or a single MLP, or one piece of waterfront real estate that could be washed away in a storm. Diversify across markets, countries, and currencies around the world. We live in a global economy, so don’t make the mistake of investing solely in your own country.
