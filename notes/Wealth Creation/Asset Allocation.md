# Asset Allocation
Nobody can ever know what the market will do so design an asset allocation that, even if your wrong, you’ll still be okay. **By owning about 15 uncorrelated investments, you can reduce your overall risk by about 80%** and you’ll increase the return-to-risk ratio by a factor of five. So, **your return is five times greater by reducing that risk.**

Asset allocation is simply a matter of establishing the right mix of different types of investments, diversifying among them in such a way that you reduce your risks and maximize your rewards.

Different asset classes don’t usually move in tandem and **success is largely dependant on smart asset allocation.** By knowing precisely how much of your money to put in different asset classes such as [[Stock Markets]], [[Bonds]], real estate, gold, and cash (see also; [[Holding Cash is a Bad Investment]]), you can protect yourself against disaster by building a portfolio that’s broadly diversified globally and also among different types of assets.

> It also helps to write down your reasons for investing in each of the assets in your portfolio, since inevitably there will be times a particular asset class or investment performs poorly, sometimes for several years. Yo may lose faith because by focusing on the short term. But when the going gets tough, you’ll be able to look over these notes and remind yourself why you own each asset and how it serves your long-term goals. As long as your needs haven’t changed and your assets are still aligned with your goals, you can sit tight and give your investments the time they need to prove their value.

There’s almost always an asset class or a country or a market that’s getting clobbered, presenting you with equally enticing opportunities for [[Asymmetric Risk Reward]].
