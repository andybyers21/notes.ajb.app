# Why Holding Cash is a Bad Investment
If you want to be certain that you’ll never lose money in the [[Stock Markets]], you can keep your savings in cash—but then you’ll never stand a chance of achieving financial freedom. As [[Warren Buffet Knowledge]] says, “We pay a high price for certainty". Simply saving money doesn’t generate future wealth. 
 
Holding cash is a poor [[Asset Allocation]] strategy. Does not provide you with [[Diversified Returns]] and does not [[Compound Interest]] over time. 

**Cash doesn’t earn a return, so it will underperform stocks over time** The challenge is that you earn nothing these days if you keep your money in cash. Even worse the value of cash will go down over time. As the market inflates, [[Inflation]]. 

At least bonds provide some income. As I see it, bonds are now the cleanest dirty clothing in the laundry pile.
