# Stock Markets

The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place. Such financial activities are conducted through institutionalised formal exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces which operate under a defined set of regulations. There can be multiple stock trading venues in a country or a region which allow transactions in stocks and other forms of securities.

There is usually a designated market for every commodity. Such dedicated markets serve as a platform where numerous buyers and sellers meet, interact and transact. Since the number of market participants is huge, one is assured of a fair price. A stock market is a designated market for trading various kinds of securities in a controlled, secure and managed the environment.

**The stock market goes up and down but in the long term (100 years) it has maintained an upward curve.** Always remember that the long-term trajectory is likely to be good, even when the short-term news is dismal and the market is getting hammered. Market turmoil isn’t something to fear. It’s the greatest opportunity to make money.

Market trends are recognised as [[Bull Markets]], [[Bear Markets]] and [[Corrections]]

**The gross return of the market minus the cost of investing equals the net return to investors. This “cost matters hypothesis” is all you need to know to understand the benefits of index investing.**
