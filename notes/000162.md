# Concatenation in Context

Here's an example concatenation being used in action:

```html
<button>Press me</button>
```

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button');

button.onclick = function () {
  let name = prompt('What is your name?');
  alert('Hello ' + name + ', nice to see you!');
};
```

Here we're using a `window.prompt()` function in line 4, which asks the user to answer a question via a popup dialog box then stores the text they enter inside a given variable, which in this case is "What is your name?". We then use a `window.alert()` function in line 5 to display another popup containing a string we've assembled from two string literals and the `name` variable, via concatenation.
