# API's

**Application Programming Interface's** allow software, computers and [[Servers]] on the web to interact and talk to one another. An API works in a similar way to any other web space ([[What happens when you visit a web page]]). An API connects your computer (or device) to dynamic web servers and returns a response. However, unlike a web page it will only return data in the form of [[Json]] or [[XML]].

An API will return an _object_ back, (see [[Object Oriented Programming]]) whereas [[RESTful Web Services]] will return you the _state of the object_ saving a large amount of overhead.

* [[RESTful Web Services]]
	* [[API's]] will send you data back from web [[Servers]] in the form of an object. This allows us to do many things but downloading all of this data comes with high overheads. This is where RESTful web services come in.
