# Replacing String Content

The `replace()` method replaces a specified value with a different value in the string. For example:

```js
str = 'Please visit Microsoft!';
var n = str.replace('Microsoft', 'W3Schools');
```

- **The `replace()` method does not change the string it is called on. It returns a new string.**
- By default, the `replace()` method replaces only the first match.
- By default, the `replace()` method is case sensitive. Writing "MICROSOFT" (with upper-case) will not work.
- To replace case insensitive, use a regular expression with an /i flag (insensitive):

```js
str = 'Please visit Microsoft!';
var n = str.replace(/MICROSOFT/i, 'W3Schools');
```

\*Note that regular expressions are written without quotes.\*\*

To replace all matches, use a regular expression with a `/g` flag (global match):

```js
str = 'Please visit Microsoft and Microsoft!';
var n = str.replace(/Microsoft/g, 'W3Schools');
```
