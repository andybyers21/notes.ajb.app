# Number Types

All types will be stored in multiples of 8 bits (1 byte).

C-Sharp intergers have min an max limits:

```cs
int max = int.MaxValue;
int min = int.MinValue;
Console.WriteLine($"The range of integers is {min} to {max}"); // The range of integers is -2147483648 to 2147483647
```

If you tried:

```cs
int what = max + 3;
Console.WriteLine($"An example of overflow: {what}");
```

You would return: `An example of overflow: -2147483646`. This is an example of "overflow" because the code has overflowed the max value by +3 and looped back to the start of it's number sequence starting at -2147483648

The range of floating point numbers is much larger than whole integers.

```cs
double max = double.MaxValue;
double min = double.MinValue;
Console.WriteLine($"The range of double is {min} to {max}"); // The range of double is -1.79769313486232E+308 to 1.79769313486232E+308
```

_NOTE: that E+308 is representing a number TO THE POWER OF 308._

The decimal type has a smaller range than double but greater precision. An M suffix is used to denote decimal types. E.g:

```cs
double a = 1.0;
double b = 3.0;
Console.WriteLine(a / b); // 0.333333333333333

decimal c = 1.0M;
decimal d = 3.0M;
Console.WriteLine(c / d); // 0.3333333333333333333333333333
```

## Integral types

Storing whole numbers. (Smallest > largest):

```cs
sbyte mySByte; // -128 to 127, signed 8 bit
byte myByte; // 0 to 255, unsigned 8 bit
short myShort; // -32,768 to 32,767, signed 16 bit
ushort myUShort; // 0 to 65,535, unsigned 16 bit
int myInt; // -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 signed 32 bit
uint myUInt; // 0 to 4,294,967,295 unsigned 32 bit
long myLong; // -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 signed 64 bit
ulong myULong; // 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 unsigned 64 bit
```

## Floating point numbers

Decimals will be rounded off to the below:

```cs
float myFloat; // Approx 6-9 digits, 32 bit
double myDouble; // Approx 15-17 digits, 64 bit
decimal myDecimal; // Approx 28-29 digits, 128 bit
```

Floating point types cannot be unsigned (this is due to CPU operation rather than a C-Sharp limitation, most languages also have this limitation).
