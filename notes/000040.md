# Corrections

A 10% fall in the [[Stock Markets]] is called a correction. On average, there’s been a market correction every year since 1900. Corrections are just a routine part of the game. **Instead of living in fear of them, you have to accept them as regular occurrences**

**Fewer than one in five corrections escalate to the point where they become a bear market.** [[Bear Markets]]

Historically, the average correction has lasted only 54 days—less than two months

In the average correction over the last 100 years, the market has fallen only 13.5%. From 1980 through the end of 2015, the average drop was 14.2%.
