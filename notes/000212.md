# Dune Reading Order

## Heros of Dune

These books are "interquels" taking place in the time between Frank Herbert's original novels, they also flash-back to events in Paul's childhood. "Heroes of Dune" is planned to be a tetralogy, but with only two books published so far, this is by force an incomplete collection.

## Short Story Collections

The majority of the above mentioned short stories can be found here.

| Name             | Author                                           | Date | Info                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Eye              | Frank Herbert                                    | 1985 | Contains both Dune and non-Dune related works |
| The Road to Dune | Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert & Kevin J. Anderson | 2005 |                                               |
| Tales of Dune    | Brian Herbert & Kevin J. Anderson                | 2011 |                                               |

"Eye" (1985) has one short story in the Dune universe, "The Road to Dune", that shares its title with the companion book from 2005 (because someone thought that was a good idea). The rest though, technically don't belong in a Dune collection. They do however give us an insight into Frank Herbert's mind, and his long life interest in the human psyche and the power struggle between the individual and the government.
