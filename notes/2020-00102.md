# Market Crash

[[Stock Markets]] crashes happen more often than you might. The key to surviving them is being prepared. They occur after significant and rapid declines in the stock market over a short period of time (potentially as short as one day in some cases). Any one-day decline of 10% or more in a single day can be described as a market crash.

A steep market decline on a key index, like the Dow Jones or the S&P 500, is usually followed by panic selling by investors which causes further panic and can lead to investment companies issuing margin Calls calling in money lent to investors so they can buy stocks and funds which forces those investors to sell at the current low prices to get their cash reserves to satisfactory levels to meet those demands.

Stock market crashes lead to severe negative outcomes such as:

- A decline in "paper wealth." (money tied up in investments)
- Jumps in unemployment
- A downward trend in the real estate market
- Banks and credit unions going under. (Banks with higher loan risk often can't recoup their loans after a prolonged market crash).
- Business suffer a significant loss to the bottom line

Throughout a crash continue to invest heavily in the stock market. Take profits from strong asset classes such as [[Bonds]] and invest the proceeds in weaker asset classes such as US small-cap and large-cap stocks, international stocks, and emerging-markets. Instead of betting on individual companies, buy index fundsto gain instant [[Diversified Returns]] at a low cost across massively undervalued markets.
