# What are Hedge Funds

Hedge funds are private funds, usually only available only to high-net-worth investors (usually via a [[Family Office]]. The managers have complete flexibility to bet on both directions of the market (up or down). They charge hefty fees (typically a minimum of 2%) and share in the profits (typically 20% of profits go to the manager).

A few of these private partnerships have performed brilliantly over many years, but it’s a minuscule minority—and the very best of them tend to be closed to new investors. The problem is, hedge funds start with a huge disadvantage in every major category: fees, risk management, transparency, and liquidity.

From 2009 to 2015, the average hedge fund lagged the S&P 500 for 6 years in a row.
