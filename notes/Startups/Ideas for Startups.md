> ‘What’s so hard about pulling a sword out of a stone? The real work’s already been done. You ought to make yourself useful and find the man who put the sword in the stone in the first place.’
> --_Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms_

You don't need amazing ideas to start. Just offer people an incremental improvement on what's avaliable right now. That's all you need to start. Then you can offer incremental improvement, additional features and add-ons in the same manner. It's easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper.

If you build the simple, inexpensive options, you'll not only find it easier to sell at first, but you'll also be in the best position to conquer the rest of the market.

**The monies in the execution, not the idea.**

If your building a fremium model put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren't, advertisers won't pay for a product with no views.

"If the people lead, the leaders will follow." Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes "get all the users, and the advertisers will follow."

Design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it. If you don't put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.

It's very dangerous to let anyone fly under you. If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you'll own the low end. And if you don't, you're in the crosshairs of whoever does.
