# What is a Startup

A Startup can be defined as a small group of people who are convinced that nobody else believes in them. It is estimated that 90% of them fail within the first year. This is touted as the big number but fails to go into specifics. [[TK - Why do Startups Fail]]

You need three things to create a successful startup:
- Good people. - If its just you, you still need a support network. Even if it's just a encouraging wife, a guy you know who knows a bit about VAT, some people on Twitter. [[Creating a Contact Management Strategy For Growth]]
- A product that customers actually want.
- Spend as little money as possible. The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. Most people will ask "haw many people do you have?" as some sort of measure of success. You should ask "how many customers do you have?" Employees should only ever be bought to fill skills gaps.

Employees, office spaces, Company cars/ vans, fancy "things" are often a choice between being impressive and seeming impressive.
- Do you want to seem impressive or be impressive?

[[TK - Why do Startups Fail]]? Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these three things. A startup that does all three will probably succeed. There are no more magical steps than this. **The three steps are doable. Hard, but doable**

What should drive people to start a startup should be looking at existing technology/ products/ services and thinking, don't these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z?

If you want [Ideas for Startups](/essays/2020/Ideas for Startups), one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do. Define their processes and figure out how you can help improve it for them. Why chose a middle size company, a small company or another startup will be too strapped for cash to pay you and try getting past the gatekeepers at a multi-national.

It's easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper.
