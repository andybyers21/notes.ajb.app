# Fuzzy vision = Fuzzy motivation
- With fuzzy vision comes fuzzy motivation. Have you ever wondered why you’re not always motivated or consistent? Part of the reason is you aren’t clear on why you’re doing what you’re doing. If you don’t know where you are going, then I can guarantee you’ll end up somewhere other than where you want to be.
- Truly productive people know the final result they are after and maintain acute clarity on what they want. they reverse-engineer this big goal into a series of small and actionable steps that they then put into a 1-2 page plan of execution.
