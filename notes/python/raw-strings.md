# Raw Strings

If you donâ€™t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters, you can use _raw strings_ by adding an `r` before the first quote:

```py
>>> print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
C:\some
ame
>>> print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote.
C:\some\name
```
