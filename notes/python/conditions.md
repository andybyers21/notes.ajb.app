# Conditions

Conditions in Python follow more of an English language approach:

- `&&` is `and`.

- `||` is `or`.

- `in` can be used to check if a specified object is within a container.

- `not` inverts booleans.

- You could also use `is` eg:

```py
if statement is true:
```

- **`==` matches values.**

- **`is` matches instances.**
