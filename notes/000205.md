# The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python

link: [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python is a living, breathing guide. An open source resource developed by real-life python developers that [anyone can contribute to on GitHub](https://github.com/realpython/python-guide)

This handcrafted guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis.

This guide is opinionated in a way that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Python’s official documentation. You won’t find a list of every Python web framework available here. Rather, you’ll find a nice concise list of highly recommended options.
