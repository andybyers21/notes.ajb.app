# Bull Markets

A [[Stock Markets]] bull market means that prices are progressively rising, going up aggressively, usually in the longer term.

Every ber market ([[Bear Markets]]) in history has eventually become a bull market, regardless of how bleak the news seemed at the time.

- _We've just ridden out the longest bull market in history. A then corona. What happens next? Will it bounce back or will this create a lengthy bear/bull bounce? Or will we just drop back into bear when we find out that professional investors can't stand the pain?_
