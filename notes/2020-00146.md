# Using Git Collaboratively

Git really shows it's magic when you start using it's capabilities in a collaborative setting, where many people might be making changes to a project. Git will keep track of **WHO** changed a file in addition to **when it was changed**, **why** and **the contents of the changes**, again, open for review by all of the other team members at any time in the future.

If more than one person makes changes to the same file Git provides you with the ability to review these changes and unify them together in what is referred to as a **merge**. A developer can work on one part of the code while a second developer works on another part. They can then use Git (and GitHub) to easily combine their changes.
