# The Switch Statement

In addition to [[If Else Statements]] JavaScript has a feature known as the `switch` statement. `switch` is a conditional that will evaluate an expression against multiple possible cases and execute one or more blocks of code against the result. The switch statement is closely related to a conditional statement containing many `else...if` blocks, and they can often be used interchangeably. `switch` is used in conjunction with `case`, `break`, and `default`

## Switch

**`switch` evaluates an expression and runs code as the result of matching cases.** The basic syntax is similar to that of an `if` statement. **It will always be written as `switch () {}`.** `()` will b ethe expression to test and `{}` is the code to run.

```js
switch (expression) {
  case x:
    // execute case x code block
    break;
  case y:
    // execute case y code block
    break;
  default:
  // execute default code block
}
```

This is an example of the `switch` statement being used with two cases and a fallback `default` code to run. It will execute in the following way:

1. Expression evaluated
2. `case x` will be evaluated and if it matches the code will execute. `break;` signifies the end of the `switch` block
3. If `case x` does not match the command will continue and evaluate `case y`. If `y` matches the code will be executed and will exit out of the `switch` block at the `break`.
4. If none of the cases match the `default` will execute.

An example:

```js
// Set the current day of the week to a variable, with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday
const day = new Date().getDay();

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log('Happy Monday!');
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("It's Tuesday. You got this!");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log('Hump day already!');
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("Just one more day 'til the weekend!");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log('Happy Friday!');
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log('Have a wonderful Saturday!');
    break;
  case 7:
    console.log("It's Sunday, time to relax!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Something went horribly wrong...');
}
```

If we omit the `break` statement the program would check the code as a whole and would be falsy. Therefor it would output the `default` statement.

## Switch Ranges

It is possible to evaluate ranges using the `switch` function. We do this by setting our expression to `true` and doing an operation within each case.

For example, if you were to write a simple grading app which would take a number score and convert it to a letter grade, with the following requirements:

Grade of 90 and above is an A
Grade of 80 to 89 is a B
Grade of 70 to 79 is a C
Grade of 60 to 69 is a D
Grade of 59 or below is an F

The code would look like this. Since we're checking a range we will require an operation in each `case` to check if the condition evaluates to true.

```js
// Set the student's grade
const grade = 87;

switch (true) {
  // If score is 90 or greater
  case grade >= 90:
    console.log('A');
    break;
  // If score is 80 or greater
  case grade >= 80:
    console.log('B');
    break;
  // If score is 70 or greater
  case grade >= 70:
    console.log('C');
    break;
  // If score is 60 or greater
  case grade >= 60:
    console.log('D');
    break;
  // Anything 59 or below is failing
  default:
    console.log('F');
}
```

## Multiple Cases

There may be occasions where multiple cases will evaluate to the same output. You can do this by using more than one `case` within a code block.

```js
// Get number corresponding to the current month, with 0 being January and 11 being December
const month = new Date().getMonth();

switch (month) {
  // January, February, March
  case 0:
  case 1:
  case 2:
    console.log('Winter');
    break;
  // April, May, June
  case 3:
  case 4:
  case 5:
    console.log('Spring');
    break;
  // July, August, September
  case 6:
  case 7:
  case 8:
    console.log('Summer');
    break;
  // October, November, December
  case 9:
  case 10:
  case 11:
    console.log('Autumn');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Something went wrong.');
}
```
