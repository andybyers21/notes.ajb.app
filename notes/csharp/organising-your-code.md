## Namespace
(an area to organize your code.)

## Class
A class is the blueprint for building objects ([[Object Oriented Programming]]). It specifies what operations objects have, provides the code and specifies how the data is stored. Classes create an object with it's own identity.

### Class `main`
The single place where an application will begin. 

## Constructor
A constructor is a member that has the same name as a class. It is used to initialize objects of that class. Constructors are called when you create an object using the `new` keyword.

Methods should end with arguments`()`.
