# Object Oriented Programming
## A definition of OOP without talking about cars or human beings.
> **C#**
> Organising code by creating types in the form of classes. Each class should be defined in a different text file to make it easier o manage big projects. Each class contains the code that represents a specific entity

Programs can be divided up into algorythems and data structures. 

- **Data Structures:** A collection of information managed in an organised way.
- **Algorithms:** A piece of code that manipulates data. A process or set of rules to follow in calculations or problem solving. 




Object-oriented programming has four basic concepts: 
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
