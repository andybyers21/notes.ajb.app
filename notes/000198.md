# Viewport Dimensions

The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is.

- `vw` (viewport width): `10vw` would be 10% of the viewport's width.
- `vh` (viewport height): `3vh` would be 3% of the viewport's height.
- `vmin` (viewport minimum): `70vmin` would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
- `vmax` (viewport maximum): `100vmax` would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
