# Update Jekyll

**Stay Up to Date**

_Update Jekyll as often as possible to benefit from the latest bug fixes._

If you installed Bundler, run `bundle update jekyll` or simply `bundle update` and all your gems will update to the latest versions.

If you don’t have Bundler installed, run `gem update jekyll`.

The procedure is similar if you use the `github-pages` gem.
