* [[What is Refactoring]]
	* **By continuously improving the design of code, we make it easier and easier to work with.** This is in sharp contrast to what typically happens: little refactoring and a great deal of attention paid to expediently adding new features. **If you get into the hygienic habit of refactoring continuously, you'll find that it is easier to extend and maintain code** and should be part of your [[Web Design]] philosophy.
