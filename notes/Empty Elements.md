# Empty Elements

Some elements contain no content and are called empty elements. For example the `<img>` element shown below:

```html
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
```

This contains two attributes but there is no closing `</img>`. This is because an image element does not wrap content to affect it. It's purpose is to embed an image in this spot in the html.
