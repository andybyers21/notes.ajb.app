# Launch and Run Jekyll Site Locally

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

To start running your website locally. You’d visit _localhost:4000_ in a browser to see your local site.

Pass the `--watch` flag to auto-rebuild your Jekyll site when a file changes. (pre-installed with Jekyll 2.1 or greater).

Hit _control + C_ at the command line to stop running the website locally.

While the site is running, after making changes to website files: save the files and refresh the webpage to see the changes —except for the _\_config.yml file_, for which you must stop running the website and restart running the website to see changes.

Typing or pasting in `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` a lot? Instead, you can type the ↑ (up arrow) at the command line to scroll through recently typed commands; just press enter after the command you want to use appears.
