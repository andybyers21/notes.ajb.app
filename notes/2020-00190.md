# The Undefined Value

The value, `undefined` also stands apart as it's own value similar to [[The Null Value]]**The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.** If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:

```js
let age;

alert(age); // shows "undefined"
```

Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable:

```js
let age = 100;

// change the value to undefined
age = undefined;

alert(age); // "undefined"
```

But this is not recommended. Normally, one uses null to assign an “empty” or “unknown” value to a variable, while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.
