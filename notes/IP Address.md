# IP Address
IP address is a set of numbers that represents a unique location on the web. If you want to send a message ([[Packets]]) to another computer you need to know the IP address to send it too. But humans have a hard time remembering these numbers so we can alias it with a domain name. IP addresses can change over time (hardware updates etc). So a static domain name is the easiest way to find another computer (server) on the network^[Websites can also be reached directly via typing the IP address into your browser if you so wish.].

IP addresses stop your information from going to the wrong computer. Every computer has an unique IP.
