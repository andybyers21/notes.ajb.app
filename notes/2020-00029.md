# Classes

The design type where everything is defined.

A class is the blueprint for building objects ([[Object Oriented Programming]]). It specifies what operations objects have, provides the code and specifies how the data is stored. Classes create an object with it's own identity.

> _Organizing code by creating types in the form of classes. Each class should be defined in a different text file to make it easier to manage big projects. Each class contains the code that represents a specific entity_

## Class `main`

The single place where an application will begin.

* [[Methods]]
	* **Methods are reusable units of work in a self contained code-block.** In C-Sharp every statement is executed within a method. Methods are blocks of code that carry out a single, pre-defined function. They can be defined inside of [[Classes]], structures and interfaces.
