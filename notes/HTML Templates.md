# HTML Templates

Back-end code is used to generate content that will populate an [[HTML]] template. When a template is used relevant content will be generated on the server then all the necessary parts will be pushed to you. For exmple, an online bank design will look the same to all users (the html template) but the details will be relevant only to you (the end user).

Similarly [[CSS]] will be written once and point to HTML on a number of different site templates.
