# A Mental Model of the Infrastructure of the Internet

At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate together.

## "Internet" and "the Web"

Although the terms are used interchangeably there is a difference. The internet is the technical infrastructure that connects all of the computers on the web. Among these computers are [[Clients & Servers]]. [[Servers]] send messages to your browser.

The internet is the infrastructure whereas the web is the service built on the infrastructure. There are several other services built on the internet such as email and chat services.
