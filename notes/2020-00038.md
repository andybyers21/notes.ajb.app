# Constructors

Constructors are functions that create new objects. A constructor is a member that has the same name as a class. It is used to initialize objects of that class. Constructors are called when you create an object using the `new` keyword.

When a constructor creates a new object this is called an _instance_. `instanceof` allows you to compare objects. (Handy for [[Debugging]])

- Use PaschalCase
