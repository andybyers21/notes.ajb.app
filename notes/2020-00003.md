# Access Modifiers

**_(WIP)_**

Access Modifiers control the ability of others to discover and call the code inside of a method.

Access modifiers for types & type members...

- Public, there are no restrictions on accessing public members from outside their class.

- Private members can only be accessed within their class.

- `void` nothing is returned, we're just executing code inside the [[Methods]]
