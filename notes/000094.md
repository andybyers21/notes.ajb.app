# JS Hexadecimal

By default, JavaScript displays numbers as base 10 decimals. But you can use the `toString()` method to output numbers from base 2 to base 36.

- Hexadecimal is base 16. Decimal is base 10. Octal is base 8. Binary is base 2.

```js
let lotsOfDecimal = 1.766584958675746364;
lotsOfDecimal;
let twoDecimalPlaces = lotsOfDecimal.toFixed(2);
twoDecimalPlaces;
```

**Do not create Number objects. It slows down execution speed. The new keyword complicates the code. This can produce some unexpected results**
