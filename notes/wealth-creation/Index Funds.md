# What are Index Funds
_Index funds are simple. Rather than try to time the market or outguess other professional money managers about the prospects of individual stocks, index funds simply buy and hold all of the stocks in a broad market index such as the S&P 500._

An unmanaged basket of leading [[Stock Markets]] stocks such as the S&P 500. The fund simply owns all the stocks in the index (for example, they would own all 500 stocks in the S&P 500). They make very few trades, so their transaction costs and tax bills are incredibly low. They also save on other expenses such as active fund managers and their teams.

Index funds take a “passive” approach to [[Asset Allocation]] that eliminates almost all trading activity. nstead of trading in and out of the market, they simply buy and hold every stock in an index

One big advantage of owning an index fund that tracks a basket of stocks such as the S&P 500 is that the weaker companies intermittently get culled and replaced by stronger ones.

Index funds allow you to invest, **at minimal cost,** in a portfolio designed for [[Diversified Returns]] and carry minimal fees as low as 0.05%. (Active investors as a group will receive the same gross return minus 2% or more). They have historiclly outpaced the market. 

In a study performed by researchers Richard Bauer and Julie Dahlquist (over more than a million market-timing sequences from 1926 to 1999) they found that holding the market (via an index fund) outperformed more than 80% of market-timing strategies.

Index funds can be highly profitble in a [[Bear Markets]] (or [[Corrections]]) to give you instant [[Diversified Returns]] (at a low cost) across massively undervalued markets.
