# Nesting Elements

You can nest elements within elements like so: `<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> ugly.</p>`. We must however make sure that elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the `<p>` element first, then the `<strong>` element; therefore, we have to close the `<strong>` element first, then the `<p>` element.

The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap your web browser will try to make a best guess attempt at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
