# Truthy and Falsy Values

When testing boolean (`true/false`) values, a common pattern you'll come across again and again. Any value that is not `false`, `undefined`, `null`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string `('')` actually returns true when tested as a conditional statement, therefore you can simply use a variable name on its own to test whether it is true, or even that it exists (that is, it is not undefined.) So for example:

```js
let cheese = 'Cheddar';

if (cheese) {
  console.log('Yay! Cheese available for making cheese on toast.');
} else {
  console.log('No cheese on toast for you today.');
}
```

And, returning to our previous example about the child doing a chore for their parent, you could write it like this:

```js
let shoppingDone = false;

if (shoppingDone) {
  // don't need to explicitly specify '=== true'
  let childsAllowance = 10;
} else {
  let childsAllowance = 5;
}
```
