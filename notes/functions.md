# Functions

Define a function using `def`

```py
def fizzbuzz(x, y):
    for n in range(x, y):
        if n % 3 == 0 and a % 5 == 0:
            print("FIZZBUZZ")
        elif n % 3 == 0:
            print("FIZZ")
        elif n % 5 == 0:
            print("BUZZ")
        else:
            print(n)
```

## Built in Functions

The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that are always available.
