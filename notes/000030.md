# Clients & Servers

Computers connected on the web are called **clients** and **[[Servers]]**.

## Clients

Clients are the end users devices that are connected to the internet. (e.g. your laptop of iPad) and the software you use to access it. (Usually your browser but you may access it through other apps and software, e.g the facebook app will show you webpages from facebook.com).

## Servers

Servers are computers that store the websites, pages and app data. When a client wants to access it a copy of the content on the server it is downloaded from the server onto your device and displayed in your browser.

* [[HTTP]]
	* HTTP is responsible for handling communication between [[Clients & Servers]] and initiates the *request/response cycle*.
* [[What happens when you visit a web page]]
	* The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to your client. This message, and all other data sent between the [[Clients & Servers]], is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
* [[A Mental Model of the Infrastructure of the Internet]]
	* Although the terms are used interchangeably there is a difference. The internet is the technical infrastructure that connects all of the computers on the web. Among these computers are [[Clients & Servers]]. [[Servers]] send messages to your browser.
