# What Django Does

Django is a high level, Python-based web framework that follows the model-template-views architectural pattern. One of the most powerful features of Django is its Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), which enables you to interact with your database, like you would with SQL. _Django's ORM is just a pythonical way to create SQL to query and manipulate your database and get results in a pythonic fashion._

Allows you to change database entries and handle SQL queries & syntax really easily.

Allows easy, effecient user authentication and authorization.
