# Site ToDo's

Items highlighted in **Bold** are first priority.

- Format code-blocks with language heading.
- Add a TOC to longer notes and essays.
- Review `README.md` and `index.md`.
- Look at app integration (obsidian > zettlr?) for note writing process. - **Look into [bear HTML export](https://blog.bear.app/2020/09/bear-1-7-15-is-out-with-new-features-for-wiki-links-html-export-and-more/)**
- Automate backlink process and git pushing (0.3.1)
- Add footnotes operation (0.3.2)
- Add subheading linking (0.3.2)

- Open external links in new tabs by default (with js) currently not possible due to markdownify parsing internal & external links to html.

  _rewrite code:_

  ```js
  // if link contains ajb.app open in same window
  // else open in new window
  ```

- ~~Add [backlinks](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor) to notes pages.~~
- ~~**Bugs in auto sort menu alphabetically**~~`
- ~~Update highlight colors for `strong` and `em` in `./_sass/overrides.scss`~~
- ~~Look into table formatting.~~
- ~~Add a main menu section for longform essays & link to them from their respective topic folders.~~
