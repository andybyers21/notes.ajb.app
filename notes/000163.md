# Conditional Operator

Sometimes we need to assign a variable based on condition. For instance:

```
let accessAllowed;
let age = prompt('How old are you?', '');

if (age > 18) {
 accessAllowed = true;
} else {
 accessAllowed = false;
}

alert(accessAllowed);
```

The question `?` mark operator (sometimes referred to as “conditional”)^[Sometimes it is also called “ternary”, because the operator has three operands. It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that many.] allows us to do that in a more succint way.

The syntax is:

```
let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
```

The condition is evaluated: if it’s truthy then value1 is returned, otherwise – value2.

The above example would read as follows:

```
let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;
```

_We can technically omit the parenthesis `( )` however **the question mark `?` has a low precedence** so it will execute after the `>` comparison._

This example will do the same thing as the previous one:

```
// the comparison operator "age > 18" executes first anyway
// (no need to wrap it into parentheses)
let accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;
```

But parentheses make the code more readable, so we recommend using them.

## Multiple ?'s

A sequence of question mark operators ? can return a value that depends on more than one condition.

```
 let age = prompt('age?', 18);

let message = (age < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :
  (age < 18) ? 'Hello!' :
  (age < 100) ? 'Greetings!' :
  'What an unusual age!';

alert( message );
```

Using `if...else` the obove would look like this:

```
if (age < 3) {
  message = 'Hi, baby!';
} else if (age < 18) {
  message = 'Hello!';
} else if (age < 100) {
  message = 'Greetings!';
} else {
  message = 'What an unusual age!';
}
```

**Sometimes a `?` will be used in place of `if`, however it is not recommended to use the question mark operator in this way.** The notation is shorter than the equivalent if statement, which appeals to some programmers. But it is less readable.
