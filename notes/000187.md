# The Null Value

The `null` value stands out as it does not belong to any of the data types in [[JavaScript]]. It forms a separate **type of its own which contains only the null value** `null` is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages. **It’s is a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.**
