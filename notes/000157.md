## Backlinks
* [[HTTP]]
	* Your HTTP requests will return [[HTTP Status Codes]]
* [[What happens when you search for content on the web?]]
	* Many of the things you’ve seen in the request/response cycle are not actually the responsibility of a programmer writing web code. The network layer – the requests to DNS, the HTTPS messages and [[HTTP Status Codes]]being sent over the internet – is handled by your computer’s operating system and the infrastructure of the internet itself. A web developer just has to place HTML code on a web server somewhere on the internet.
