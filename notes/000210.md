# OS module

## os.path

Creates paths for multiple operating systems. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html)

```py
Import os
```

The main purpose of the OS module is to interact with your operating system. The primary use for it is to create folders, remove folders, move folders, and sometimes change the working directory. You can also access the names of files within a file path by doing `listdir()`.
