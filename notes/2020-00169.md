# Increment and Decrement

Increasing or decreasing a value by one is the most common numerical operations. This can be done by

`++` - Increase variable by 1
`--` - Decrease variable by 1

There is some difference between `++variable` and `variable++`

```js
let y = 0;
let x = y++; // x is 0 because y was incremented *after* it was stored in x, y is 1

y = 0; // reset y to 0

x = ++y; // x is 1 because y is incremented *before* it's assigned to x, y is also 1
```

`++` or `--` operator _before_ the variable? the incremented value is assigned. _after_ the variable? the original value is assigned. the incremented variable is then updated

**Note, Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like 5++ will give an error.**

The operators ++/-- can be used inside expressions as well. Their precedence is higher than most other arithmetical operations, for example:

```js
let counter = 1;
alert(2 * ++counter);
```
