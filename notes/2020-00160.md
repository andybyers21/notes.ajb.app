# BigInt

In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than 9007199254740991 (that's 253<sup>1</sup>), or less than -253-<sup>1</sup> for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation. For most cases that will be enough but in some special cases such as cryptography we will need to use the `BigInt` value. Which is created by adding `n` to the end of an integer.

`const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;`

_Note: Right now BigInt is supported in Firefox/Chrome/Edge, but not in Safari/IE_
