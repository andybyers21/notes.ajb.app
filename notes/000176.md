# Naming a Function

Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does.

It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes.

For instance, functions that start with "show" usually show something.

Function starting with…

`"get…"` – return a value,
`"calc…"` – calculate something,
`"create…"` – create something,
`"check…"` – check something and return a boolean, etc.

Examples of such names:

```javascript
showMessage(..)     // shows a message
getAge(..)          // returns the age (gets it somehow)
calcSum(..)         // calculates a sum and returns the result
createForm(..)      // creates a form (and usually returns it)
checkPermission(..) // checks a permission, returns true/false
```

With prefixes in place, a glance at a function name gives an understanding what kind of work it does and what kind of value it returns.

## Ultrashort function names

Functions that are used very often sometimes have ultrashort names.

For example, the jQuery framework defines a function with `$`. The Lodash library has its core function named `_`.

These are exceptions. Generally functions names should be concise and descriptive.
