# Variables in JavaScript

Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:

- An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
- A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.

Variables are used to store this information. They are “named storage” containers for data that store values. We can use variables to store data like customer names, email addresses etc.

You start by declaring a variable with the `var` or `let` keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:

`let myVariable;`

This statement creates (or in other words **declares**) a variable with the name `myVariable`. **JavaScript is case sensitive.** This means `myVariable` is not the same as `myvariable`. If you have problems in your code, check the case!

- A semi-colon `;` at the end of the line indicates that a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.
- You can name a variable pretty much anything you like. [With some minor execptions](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6). Check your naming [here](https://mothereff.in/js-variables).

After declaring a variable you can give it a value:

```js
let myVariable = 'Bob';
```

You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:

```js
myVariable;
```

After assigning a variable to a variable you can change the value any time you like in the code:

```js
let myVariable = 'Bob';
myVariable = 'Steve';
```

We put data into a variable by using the assignment operator `=`

```js
let message;
message = 'Hello'; // store the string
```

Once the string is stored in the memory we can call it by using the variable name:

```js
let message;
message = 'Hello!';

alert(message); // shows the variable content
```

To be concise we can combine the variable and the assignment in the same line (as in the above `Bob` example):

```js
let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!
```

We can also declare multiple variables in one line:

```js
let user = 'John',
  age = 25,
  message = 'Hello';
```

- This is shorter but not recommended as it makes your code less readable. To make your code easily readable assign one variable to one line:

```js
let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';
```

You can also use a multiline style:

```js
let user = 'John',
  age = 25,
  message = 'Hello';
```

Or the comma method:

```js
let user = 'John',
  age = 25,
  message = 'Hello';
```

Technically the one line method, multiline and comma methods all do the same thing so you can do whatever works for you.

- [[A Variable Should Have Clear and Obvious Naming]]

_Older scripts tend to make use of `var` to define a variable. (Instead of `let`). There are minor differences between the two but that doesn't matter too much as a beginner so just stick with `let` for now. _

## Variables may hold values that have different data types:

| Variable | Explanation                                                                                                                       | Example                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| String   | This is a sequence of text known as a string. '**To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks'**.      | `let myVariable = 'Bob';`                                                                                                    |
| Number   | This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.                                                                          | `let myVariable = 10;`                                                                                                       |
| Boolean  | **This is a True/False value.** The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.                        | `let myVariable = true;`                                                                                                     |
| Array    | This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.                                               | `let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];` Refer to each member of the array like this: `myVariable[0]`, `myVariable[1]`, etc. |
| Object   | This can be anything. **Everything in JavaScript is an object**, and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn. | `let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');` All of the above examples too.                                              |

_Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image in an image gallery._
