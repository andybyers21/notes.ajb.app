# HTTP

**HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol**

- HTTP is responsible for handling communication between [[Clients & Servers]] and initiates the _request/response cycle_.
- _HTTP is stateless_, every request is independent of one another and not reliant on the previous transaction. (Tools like cookies and local storage can help to deal with this).

## HTTPS

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol **Secure**

- Data is sent via [[SSL]] or [[TLS]] for example. (You can add a SSL certificate to your web host). Which helps when dealing with sensitive info and require a higher level of security such as card payments or users personal data. Many websites will now use https exclusively for an extra layer of security.

## HTTP Methods/Requests

**GET** : _Retrieves data from the server_ (load pages and assets etc). Every time you visit a web page you are making a get request.

**POST** : _Submits data to the server_, adding resources, submit forms, comments etc. Usually to be stored in a database somewhere.

**PUT** : _Updates data on the server_

**DELETE** : _Removes data from the server_

- Your HTTP requests will return [[HTTP Status Codes]]

## Using the browser's inspector to review requests

- Use the `Network` tabin the inspector. Make requests and inspector will show you what they are (and any apparent errors).
- `Headers`, will show you the [[HTTP Header Fields]]
- Narrow it down by files, requests, responses etc.
