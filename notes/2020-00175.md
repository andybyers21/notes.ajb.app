# Modify-in-Place

Sometimes we will need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in the same variable. For example:

```js
let n = 2;
n = n + 5;
n = n * 2;
```

This notation can be shortened using the operators `+=` and `*=`:

```js
let n = 2;
n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)

alert(n); // 14
```

Short “modify-and-assign” operators exist for all arithmetical and bitwise operators: /=, -=, etc.

Such operators have the same precedence as a normal assignment, so they run after most other calculations:

```js
let n = 2;

n *= 3 + 5;

alert(n);

// 16 (right part evaluated first, same as n \*= 8)
```
