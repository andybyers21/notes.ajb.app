# Writing JS code

## if...else

[[If Else Statements]] are probably the most common conditional statement you will use in JavaScript. Basic `if...else` syntax looks like the following in pseudocode:

```js
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```

Here we've got:

1. The keyword if followed by some parentheses.
2. A condition to test, placed inside the parentheses (typically "is this value bigger than this other value?", or "does this value exist?"). The condition makes use of the comparison operators we discussed in the last module and returns true or false.
3. set of curly braces, inside which we have some code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition returns true.
4. The keyword else.
5. Another set of curly braces, inside which we have some more code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition is not true — or in other words, the condition is false.

- This code is pretty human-readable — it is saying "if the condition returns true, run code A, else run code B"

You don't have to include the `else` and the second curly brace block. The following is also perfectly legal code:

```js
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
}

run some other code
```

However, you need to be careful here. In this case, the second block of code is not controlled by the conditional statement, so it always runs, regardless of whether the condition returns true or false. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it might not be what you want — often you want to run one block of code or the other, not both.

You may sometimes see `if...else` statements written without the curly braces, in the following shorthand style:

```js
if (condition) code to run if condition is true
else run some other code instead
```

This is perfectly valid code, but using it is not recommended — it is much easier to read the code and work out what is going on if you use the curly braces to delimit the blocks of code, and use multiple lines and indentation.

There is a way to chain on extra choices/outcomes to your `if...else`, by using `else if`. Each extra choice requires an additional block to put in between `if() { ... }` and `else { ... }`. Check out the following more involved example, which could be part of a simple weather forecast application:

```html
// create a drop down to select the weather type today

<label for="weather">Select the weather type today: </label>
<select id="weather">
  <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
  <option value="sunny">Sunny</option>
  <option value="rainy">Rainy</option>
  <option value="snowing">Snowing</option>
  <option value="overcast">Overcast</option>
</select>

<p></p>
```

```js
// create responses to ypou choice in the drop down

const select = document.querySelector('select');
const para = document.querySelector('p');

select.addEventListener('change', setWeather);

function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;

  if (choice === 'sunny') {
    para.textContent =
      'It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.';
  } else if (choice === 'rainy') {
    para.textContent =
      "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
  } else if (choice === 'snowing') {
    para.textContent =
      'The snow is coming down — it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.';
  } else if (choice === 'overcast') {
    para.textContent =
      "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
  } else {
    para.textContent = '';
  }
}
```
