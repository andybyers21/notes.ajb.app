# JavaScript Precision

Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits.

`var x = 999999999999999;` _// x will be 999999999999999_
`var y = 9999999999999999;` _// y will be 10000000000000000_

The maximum number of decimals is 17 (but floating point arithmetic is not always completely accurate).
