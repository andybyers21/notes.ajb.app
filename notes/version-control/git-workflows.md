# Git Workflows
## Basic Git Workflow
1. Modify the files in your **working tree**
2. Selectively stage the files you want to be part of your next commit as you work. (Which adds only those changes to the staging area.) 
3. **Commit** the files that you wish to be updated in your database. Git will take the files from the staging area and create snapshots of the data to add it permanently to your VCS.

If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, itâ€™s considered committed. If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.
