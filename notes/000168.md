# If Else Statements

You will often need to perform different actions for different decisions which is done by using [[Conditionals in JavaScript]]

- `if` is used to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- `else` is used to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed^[To be discussed in a later section.]

## if

Use the `if` statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true. _Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate a JavaScript error._

Syntax:

```js
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

For example, make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18:00

```js
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = 'Good day';
}
```

## else

Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false:

```
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

For example, if the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise "Good evening":

```js
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = 'Good day';
} else {
  greeting = 'Good evening';
}
```

## else if

Use `else if` statements to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

```js
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```

If time is less than 10:00, create a "Good morning" greeting, if not, but time is less than 20:00, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise a "Good evening":

```js
if (time < 10) {
  greeting = 'Good morning';
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = 'Good day';
} else {
  greeting = 'Good evening';
}
```

* [[Writing JS code]]
	* [[If Else Statements]] are probably the most common conditional statement you will use in JavaScript. Basic `if...else` syntax looks like the following in pseudocode:
* [[The Switch Statement]]
	* In addition to [[If Else Statements]] JavaScript has a feature known as the `switch` statement. `switch` is a conditional that will evaluate an expression against multiple possible cases and execute one or more blocks of code against the result. The switch statement is closely related to a conditional statement containing many `else...if` blocks, and they can often be used interchangeably. `switch` is used in conjunction with `case`, `break`, and `default`
