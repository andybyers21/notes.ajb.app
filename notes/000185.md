# The NOT Logical Operator

NOT is represented by an exclamation mark `result = !value;`

The operator accepts a single value, converts it to boolean and returns the opposite value. For example:

```js
alert(!true); // false
alert(!0); // true
```

## A double NOT `!!` can be used for converting a value to boolean type

```js
alert(!!'non-empty string'); // true
alert(!!null); // false
```

The first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.

There’s a little more verbose way to do the same thing – a built-in Boolean function:

```js
alert(Boolean('non-empty string')); // true
alert(Boolean(null)); // false
```

**The precedence of NOT `!` is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before [[The AND Logical Operator]]` or [[The OR Logical Operator]].**
