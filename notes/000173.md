# JavaScript Operators

Operators are mathematical symbols

| **Operator**                          | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Symbol**(s) | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Addition                              | Add two numbers together or combine two strings.                                                                                                                                                                      | +             | `'Hello ' + 'world!';`, `2+2;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Subtraction, Multiplication, Division | These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.                                                                                                                                                                  | - \* /        | `9 - 3;`, `8 * 2;`, `9 / 3;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Assignment                            | Assigns a value to a variable.                                                                                                                                                                                        | =             | `let myVariable = 'Bob';`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Equality                              | Performs a test to see if two values are equal. **Returns a `true`/`false` (Boolean) result**.                                                                                                                        | ===           | `let myVariable = 3;`, ask `myVariable === 4;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Not, Does-not-equal                   | This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a `true` into a `false`, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal. | !, !==        | For "Not", the basic expression is `true`, but the comparison returns `false` because we negate it: `let myVariable = 3;` `!(myVariable === 3);` - "Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing "is `myVariable` NOT equal to 3". This returns `false` because `myVariable` IS equal to 3: `let myVariable = 3;` `myVariable !== 3;` |

> **Note**: Mixing data types can lead to some strange results when performing calculations. Be careful that you are referring to your variables correctly, and getting the results you expect. For example, enter '35' + '25' into your console. Why don't you get the result you expected? Because the quote marks turn the numbers into strings, so you've ended up concatenating strings rather than adding numbers. If you enter, 35 + 25 you'll get the total of the two numbers.

## Comparison Operators

| **Operator** | **Name**                 | **Purpose**                                                              | **Example** |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| ===          | Strict equality          | Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one another     | 5 === 2 + 4 |
| !==          | Strict-non-equality      | Tests whether the left and right values are not identical to one another | 5 !== 2 + 3 |
| <            | Less than                | Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one.              | 10 < 6      |
| >            | Greater than             | Tests whether the left value is greater than the right one.              | 10 > 20     |
| <=           | Less than or equal to    | Tests whether the left value is smaller than or equal to the right one.  | 3 <= 2      |
| >=           | Greater than or equal to | Tests whether the left value is greater than or equal to the right one.  | 5 >= 4      |

Adding these values will return a `true/false` value. _See [[Variables in JavaScript]], Booleans._ These are very useful, as they allow us to make decisions in our code, and they are used every time we want to make a choice of some kind. For example, booleans can be used to:

- Display the correct text label on a button depending on whether a feature is turned on or off
- Display a game over message if a game is over or a victory message if the game has been won
- Display the correct seasonal greeting depending what holiday season it is
- Zoom a map in or out depending on what zoom level is selected

	* We've already covered some of JavaScripts mathematical comparisons in the section [[JavaScript Operators]]. Here we'll cover different types of comparisons, how JavaScript makes them and important peculiarities. **All comparison operators return a `true/false` boolean result.** A comparison result can be assigned to a variable, just like any other value:
