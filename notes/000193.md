# Unary

`+`

The need to convert strings to numbers arises very often. For example, if we are getting values from HTML form fields, they are usually strings. If we want to sum them the binary plus would add them as strings:

```js
let apples = '2';
let oranges = '3';

alert(apples + oranges);

// "23"
```

The binary plus concatenates strings. If we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:

```js
let apples = '2';
let oranges = '3';

// both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
alert(+apples + +oranges);

// 5 or the longer variant:
```

```js
alert(Number(apples) + Number(oranges));

// 5
```
