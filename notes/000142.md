# Tuples and Lists

```py
list = []
tuple = ()
```

You can use the `type()` object to see what it is your working with.

```py
print(type(list_or_tuple))
```

The key difference being:

- **Lists are mutable**

- **Tuples are immutable**

You can modify a list once declared but not a tuple.

- **Since lists are mutable they cannot be used in [[Dictionaries]].**

- **Since Tuples are mutable they cannot be copied.**

If you try to copy a tuple it will simply return itself. If you run `tuple(tuple_name)`, it will immediately return itself:

```py
names = (‘Nicholas’, ‘Michelle’, ‘Alex’)
copyNames = tuple(names)
print(names is copyNames)
```

Outputs:

```py
True
```

The two are the same.

In contrast, `list(list_name)` requires copying of all data to a new list, for example:

```py
names = [‘Nicholas’, ‘Michelle’, ‘Alex’]
copyNames = list(names)
print(names is copyNames)
```

Outputs

```py
False
```

Memory is allocated to tuples in larger blocks with a low overhead, because they are immutable. Tuples will use less memory than a dynamic list. **A list has a variable size, a tuple is allocated a fixed size.**

* [[Dictionaries]]
	* Dictionaries are similar to arrays. They use **keys** and **values** to manage data (rather than indexes). Each value can be accessed by calling it's key. A value can be any object (strings, ints, lists etc). **Only immutable object can be written to a dictionary. Use tuples, not lists.** (Ref: [[Tuples and Lists]])
