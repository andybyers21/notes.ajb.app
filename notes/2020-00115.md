# Packages

**Packages are namespaces that contain multiple packages and modules.** It's a directory with a twist. Each package is a directory and as such must contain `__init__.py` to indicate that the directory contains a python package. (This can be blank). For example:

- directory foo, package name
- module bar, within foo

to use `bar`

```py
import foo.bar
```

This way we must use the prefix `foo` each time we wish to access the module (`bar`)

_- or -_

```py
import foo from bar
```

This way we've imported the module first so don't need to specify the prefix every time we call it.
