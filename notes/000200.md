# Show hidden files and folders on Catalina

For whatever reason Apple has made it rather difficult to show hidden files and folders on MacOS. They've changed the default shortcuts and requires some sort of terminal workaround that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.

The best option I have thus far is `cmd` + `shift` + `fn` + `period`.

_YMMV_
