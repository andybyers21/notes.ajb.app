## Backlinks
* [[Image Elements]]
	* [[HTML]]
* [[Introduction to Front End Coding]]
	* Front end coding lives primarily in your browser. When you search or click a link your browser receives [[HTML]] files from the server, which will in turn tell the browser to retreive the [[CSS]], [[JavaScript]] or whatever other files it requires. You browser will the figure out how to put it all together based on the instructions from the HTML.
* [[Div Tags]]
	* ***[[HTML]] and [[CSS]] describe the content and appearance of a page, as well as links to other resources.***
* [[CSS Basics]]
	* **Cascading Style Sheets** are applied to [[HTML]] to define how elements should look. CSS is embedded into the HTML code or can be referenced by link to an HTML page. The style sheet defines the appearance of a web page or app by defining rules and properties that an element must display. **These rules are defined by a selector**. Like HTML, CSS is also not a programming language. Nor is it a markup language (which HTML is). Rather it is a *style sheet language.*
* [[HTML Templates]]
	* Back-end code is used to generate content that will populate an [[HTML]] template. When a template is used relevant content will be generated on the server then all the necessary parts will be pushed to you. For exmple, an online bank design will look the same to all users (the html template) but the details will be relevant only to you (the end user).
* [[CMS - content management systems]]
	* You write content into a **content management system**. This content is then converted into [[HTML]], and placed into templates at the right places to generate full pages for your site.
