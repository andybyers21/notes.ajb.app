* [[Div Tags]]
  - **_[[HTML]] and [[CSS]] describe the content and appearance of a page, as well as links to other resources._**
* [[HTML Templates]]
  - Back-end code is used to generate content that will populate an [[HTML]] template. When a template is used relevant content will be generated on the server then all the necessary parts will be pushed to you. For exmple, an online bank design will look the same to all users (the html template) but the details will be relevant only to you (the end user).
* [[CSS Basics]]
  - **Cascading Style Sheets** are applied to [[HTML]] to define how elements should look. CSS is embedded into the HTML code or can be referenced by link to an HTML page. The style sheet defines the appearance of a web page or app by defining rules and properties that an element must display. **These rules are defined by a selector**. Like HTML, CSS is also not a programming language. Nor is it a markup language (which HTML is). Rather it is a _style sheet language._
