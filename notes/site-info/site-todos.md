# Site ToDo's

Items highlighted in **Bold** are first priority.

- Add [backlinks](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor) to notes pages.
- **Bugs in auto sort menu alphabetically**
- Add a TOC to longer notes and essays.
- Review `README.md` and `index.md`.
    - Add links to topics listed on homepage.
- **Todo checkboxes `- [ ]` currently do not format correctly**
- Update highlight colors for `strong` and `em` in `./_sass/overrides.scss`
    - Create a note on why these colors are used (ref: [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/#:~:text=Progressive%20Summarization%20focuses%20therefore%20on,little%20as%20the%20information%20deserves.) by Tiago Forte).
- Look into table formatting.
- **Footnotes**
- Add a main menu section for longform essays & link to them from their respective topic folders.
- **Differentiate internal & external links.**
- Open external links in new tabs by default (with js) currently not possible due to markdownify parsing internal & external links to html.
- Add a light mode color scheme and apply automatically based on users environment.
