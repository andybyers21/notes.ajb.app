# Site ToDo's

Items highlighted in **Bold** are first priority.

- Add [backlinks](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor) to notes pages.
- **Bugs in auto sort menu alphabetically**
- Add a TOC to longer notes and essays.
- Review `README.md` and `index.md`.
  - Add links to topics listed on homepage.
- **Todo checkboxes `- [ ]` currently do not format correctly**
- Add footnotes operation
- Open external links in new tabs by default (with js) currently not possible due to markdownify parsing internal & external links to html.

  _rewrite code:_

  ```js
  // if link contains ajb.app open in same window
  // else open in new window
  ```

- ~~Update highlight colors for `strong` and `em` in `./_sass/overrides.scss`~~
- ~~Look into table formatting.~~
- ~~Add a main menu section for longform essays & link to them from their respective topic folders.~~
