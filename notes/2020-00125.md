# How to replace the default email app on a Mac

_Apple hasn't really made it obvious to replace the default email app on a Mac._

1. Ensure that your third-party email app is all set up and your email accounts have been moved.
2. Launch your new mail app.
3. Launch the default Apple Mail app.
4. Go to preferences: `Command + ,`.
5. Under the general tab, click on the dropdown options for 'Default email reader:' and choose your new email app from the list.
