# Anonymous Functions

Sometimes you will see a function that has no name. This is called an anonymous function, It won't do anything on it's own but will often be used with an event handler:

```javascript
function() {
  alert('hello');
}
```

For example the following would run the code inside the function whenever the associated button is clicked:

```javascript
const myButton = document.querySelector('button');

myButton.onclick = function () {
  alert('hello');
};
```

The above example would require there to be a `<button>` element available on the page to select and click.

You can also **assign an anonymous function to be the value of a variable**, for example:

```javascript
const myGreeting = function () {
  alert('hello');
};
```

This function could now be invoked using:

```javascript
myGreeting();
```

This effectively gives the function a name; you can also assign the function to be the value of multiple variables, for example:

```javascript
let anotherGreeting = myGreeting;
```

This function could now be invoked using either of:

```javascript
myGreeting();
anotherGreeting();
```

But this would just be confusing, so don't do it! When creating functions. You will mainly use anonymous functions to just run a load of code in response to an event firing — like a button being clicked — using an event handler. Again, this looks something like this:

```javascript
myButton.onclick = function () {
  alert('hello');
  // I can put as much code
  // inside here as I want
};
```
