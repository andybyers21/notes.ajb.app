# Clients & Servers

Computers connected on the web are called **clients** and **servers**.

## Clients

Clients are the end users devices that are connected to the internet. (e.g. your laptop of iPad) and the software you use to access it. (Usually your browser but you may access it through other apps and software, e.g the facebook app will show you webpages from facebook.com).

## Servers

Servers are computers that store the websites, pages and app data. When a client wants to access it a copy of the content on the server it is downloaded from the server onto your device and displayed in your browser.
