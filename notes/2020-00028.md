# Classes and Objects

**Everything in python is an object.** (Ref: [[Object Oriented Programming]]) Objects are an encapsulation of variables, [[Functions]] etc into a single entity. **Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are a template of your objects.** Note: Classes cannot be empty, every class must have at least one object. (_use `pass` if your class is empty_).

To assign a class to an object:

```py
object_name = ClassName
```

Now `object_name` holds and object of `ClassName`

## To access a variable within a class

Works much like any other variable

```py
object.variable
```

## To access a function within a class

```py
new_object.function()
```

## Backlinks
* [[Modules]]
	* A python module can contain a set of variables, [[Functions]] and [[Classes and Objects]]. **A module is a mini-program in itself.**
* [[Constructors and Self]]
	* Remember, a class is a template for an object (Ref; [[Classes and Objects]]). You can create many objects, known as instances, from your class. Every time you create an object from a class it will create new [[Namespaces]] for that instance. A constructor is responsible for calculating that memory allocated to that instance (`()` is your constructor) which will call the `__init__` method for you. The constructor is called automatically every time you create a new instance.
