# Structuring a Django Project

A trend in some Django applications is to structure your repositories poorly due to the new bundled application templates, by running:

```shell
$ django-admin.py startproject samplesite
```

The resulting repository structure looks like this:

```py
README.rst
samplesite/manage.py
samplesite/samplesite/settings.py
samplesite/samplesite/wsgi.py
samplesite/samplesite/sampleapp/models.py
```

Repetitive paths are confusing for both you and anyone working with your codebase. Unnecessary nesting doesn’t help anybody.

```shell
$ django-admin.py startproject samplesite .
```

**Note the “.”.**

The resulting structure:

```py
README.rst
manage.py
samplesite/settings.py
samplesite/wsgi.py
samplesite/sampleapp/models.py
```

Plan on [[Structuring Your Python Project]] correctly from the outset.
