# The typeof Operator

**(_WIP_)**

The `typeof` operator returns the type of the argument. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check. It suppoprts two forms of syntax:

1. As an operator: `typeof x`. ==links==
2. As a function: `typeof(x)`.

The result will be the same in both forms. The call `typeof x` returns a string with type name:

```js
typeof undefined; // "undefined"

typeof 0; // "number"

typeof 10n; // "bigint"

typeof true; // "boolean"

typeof 'foo'; // "string"

typeof Symbol('id'); // "symbol"

typeof Math; // "object"  (1)

typeof null; // "object"  (2)

typeof alert; // "function"  (3)
```

The last three lines may need additional explanation:

> 1. Math is a built-in object that provides mathematical operations. We will learn it in the > chapter Numbers. ==link== Here, it serves just as an example of an object.
> 2. The result of typeof null==link== is "object". That’s an officially recognized error in > typeof behavior, coming from the early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility.
> 3. The result of typeof alert is "function", because alert is a function. There is no > special “function” type in JavaScript. Functions belong to the object type. But typeof > treats them differently, returning "function". That also comes from the early days of > JavaScript. Technically, such behavior isn’t correct, but can be convenient in practice
