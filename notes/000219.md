# Note Link Janitor

Backlinks maintained using Andy Matuschak's [note link janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor)

This script reads in a folder of Markdown files, notes all the [[wiki-style links]] between them, then adds a special "backlinks" section which lists passages which reference a given file.

> ### Assumptions/warnings
>
> 1. Links are formatted `[[like this]]`.
> 2. Note titles are inferred from the first line of each note, which is assumed to be formatted as a heading, i.e. `# Note title`.
> 3. All `.md` files are siblings; the script does not currently recursively traverse subtrees (though that would be a simple modification if you need it; see `lib/readAllNotes.ts`)
> 4. The backlinks "section" is defined as the AST span between `## Backlinks` and the next heading tag (or `<!-- -->` tag). Any text you might add to this >section will be clobbered. Don't append text after the backlinks list without a heading in between! (I like to leave my backlinks list at the end >of the file)
