# Attributes

Elements can also have attributes which don't appear in the end user content, such as `<p class="editor quote">This is the best thing I've ever read</p>` in which case the attribute is `class="editor quote"`. In this example `class` is the attribute name and `"editor quote"` is the attribute value. - The `class` attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can be used to target the content of the element. (With CSS for example).
Attributes should always have the following: - A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes). - The attribute name followed by an equal sign. - The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

> Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters `" ' = < > )` can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.

* [[CSS Basics]]
	* The examples above use element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well such as [[Attributes]] and class selectors. There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see the [MDN Selectors guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors).
