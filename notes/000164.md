# Conditionals in JavaScript

Conditionals are a code structure designed to test is an expression equals true or false. For example:

```javascript
let iceCream = 'chocolate';
if (iceCream === 'chocolate') {
  alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');
} else {
  alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');
}
```

the `if( ... )` is the test. This uses the identity operator (as described above) to compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. What you are doing above is basically saying if `iceCream` = `chocolate` then return the message _'Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!'_ If the answer does not = `chocolate` then _'Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...'_

If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the `else` statement—runs instead.
