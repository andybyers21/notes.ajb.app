# HTML Web Links

To add a link we need to use an `<a>` anchor tag

```html
<a href="https://futurelearn.com">The FutureLearn website</a>
```

- The `a` stands for anchor tag
- `href` is an attribute which defines a target. (In this case a URL)
- **Attributes should be specified within the opening of a tag** (but not the closing)

You might get unexpected results if you omit the `https://` or `http://`, the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.
