# Objects and Symbols

In JavaScript all other data types are called "primitive" because their values can contain only a single thing. (such as a string, a number or a true/false reading). The `object` type is special as it follows [[Object Oriented Programming]] principals and is **used to store collections of data and more complex entities.**

The `symbol` type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.
