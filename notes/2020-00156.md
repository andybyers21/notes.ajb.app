# RESTful Web Services

[[API's]] will send you data back from web [[Servers]] in the form of an object. This allows us to do many things but downloading all of this data comes with high overheads. This is where RESTful web services come in.

A REST API converts these objects into states and returns only the values that you require.

## CRUD in relation to REST

**C** | Create | _Post_ |
**R** | Read | _Get_ |
**U** | Update | _Put_ |
**D** | Delete | _Delete_ |
