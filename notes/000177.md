# NaN is Not a Number

NaN is a [[JavaScript]] specific word that indicates that a string is non-numeric. Watch out for NaN. If you use NaN in a mathematical operation, the result will also be NaN (or a concatenation).

```js
var x = 100 / 'Apple'; // x will be NaN (Not a Number)
```

if the string contains only numbers, the result will be a number

```js
var x = 100 / '10'; // x will be 10
```

You can use the global JavaScript function isNaN() to find out if a value is a number:
