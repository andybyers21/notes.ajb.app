# Functions

Define a function using `def`

```py
def fizzbuzz(x, y):
    for n in range(x, y):
        if n % 3 == 0 and a % 5 == 0:
            print("FIZZBUZZ")
        elif n % 3 == 0:
            print("FIZZ")
        elif n % 5 == 0:
            print("BUZZ")
        else:
            print(n)
```

## Built in Functions

The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that are always available.

## Backlinks
* [[Classes and Objects]]
	* **Everything in python is an object.** (Ref: [[Object Oriented Programming]]) Objects are an encapsulation of variables, [[Functions]] etc into a single entity. **Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are a template of your objects.** Note: Classes cannot be empty, every class must have at least one object. (*use `pass` if your class is empty*).
* [[Namespaces]]
	* **Enclosing**, defined within [[Functions]].
* [[Modules]]
	* A python module can contain a set of variables, [[Functions]] and [[Classes and Objects]]. **A module is a mini-program in itself.**
* [[Python Naming Conventions]]
	* Variables should follow the same conventions as [[Functions]]
