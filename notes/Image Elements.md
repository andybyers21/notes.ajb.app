# Image Elements

```html
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
```

embeds an image into the desired place in our document via the `src`, **source** attribute. The `alt`, **alternative** attribute specifies the text to be displayed when a user cannot view the image.

**The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys.**
